With live performances from as the backtrack for \u2018s show, the creative director brings Hollywood icons to the runway through wardrobe. Inspired by some of his favorite Hollywood characters, merging stagecraft with handcraft, AMIRI fuses together modern male iconographies with contemporary styling. Heavily inspired by the retro \u201970s jazz era, in both music and fashion, the runway show transports showgoers to a different time period. The attire was inspired by mid-century Jazz and Big Band idols, sharing a versatile idea of going from the stage to the streets with ease. Casual staples see the dapper man wear a contemporary, oversized suit featuring dramatized lapels and flared pants, paired with a crossover or continental tie. Bedazzled blazers give these modern tuxedos an extra sense of suave and formality, while textures and satin chore jackets accentuate the boxy silhouette. A nod to the jazz band, AMIRI reveals accessories such as a base drum bag, treble clef pins and many more musical motifs. One of the t-shirts read, \u201cJazz Hideaway\u201d on the front, a t-shirt Mike wore to take his final bow, another nod to the musical genre and the drama that comes with it. Wallet chains are added to casual denim trousers as well as suit pants, showing the versatility of the piece and the ability to dress up or down for any occassion. Check out the collection above.",

    "description": "Climate change is leading to a rise in nighttime warming, which is impacting sleep quality and human health in India and across the globe, said the analysis by Climate Central and Climate Trends",
    "content": "With Mumbai seeing the highest changes in the nighttime temperatures, India continues to suffer a severe heatwave, a new analysis on Friday showed climate change added nearly 50 to 80 nights each year where the temperature exceeded 25 degrees Celsius, with serious impacts on sleep and health. Climate change is leading to a rise in nighttime warming, which is impacting sleep quality and human health in India and across the globe, said the analysis by Climate Central and Climate Trends. ADVERTISEMENT Nighttime temperatures have increased even more rapidly than daytime temperatures as the world heats up due to climate change, primarily caused by burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas. As one of the countries most vulnerable to the impacts of the climate crisis, India has experienced a significant rise in minimum nighttime temperatures over the last decade due to climate change. The national capital on June 18 experienced its warmest night in at least 12 years, with the mercury touching 35.2 degrees Celsius, says the India Meteorological Department. This is the city's highest minimum temperature since 1969. The analysis shows that nearly 50 to 80 days each year were added above this threshold by climate change in cities across Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir, and Andhra Pradesh between 2018 and 2023. Among the metro cities, Mumbai has seen the highest changes in the nighttime temperatures, with the city experiencing an additional 65 days of warmer nights due to global warming. West Bengal and Assam are the regions that have been most impacted, with cities like Jalpaiguri, Guwahati, Silchar, Dibrugarh and Siliguri experiencing between 80 and 86 additional days each year above the 25 degrees threshold due to climate change, on average. Several cities saw between 15 and 50 additional days where the minimum temperatures exceeded 25 degrees due to the influence of climate change, including Jaipur, with an additional 19 hot nights attributable to climate change. Meanwhile, in both observations and in the counterfactual climate, the nighttime summer temperatures across India often exceed 20 degrees over the entire summer period. The cities that had the largest number of days where the minimum temperature exceeded 20 degrees due to climate change are Gangtok, Darjeeling, Shimla, and Mysore, with an average of 54, 31, 30, and 26 days added by climate change, respectively. Higher nighttime temperatures can cause physiological discomfort and impact human health by preventing body temperature from cooling off during the night, increasing mortality risks. There is also a growing body of evidence that as nighttime temperatures rise, it is adversely affecting the quality and length of sleep. Poor sleep adversely affects physical and mental health, cognitive functioning and even life expectancy. Hot nights can have disproportionate impacts on vulnerable groups, including the elderly and people, who do not have access to proper cooling mechanisms. These findings come during a week that saw new records for nighttime heat in several Indian cities. On June 19, Delhi shattered the all-time high minimum temperature record, with the mercury reaching 35.2 degrees overnight. Delhi recorded almost four numbers of additional nights over 25 degrees between 2018 and 2023, according to the Climate Central analysis. On June 18, Alwar in Rajasthan had a minimum temperature of 37 degrees, the highest-ever nighttime temperature since records began in 1969. Alwar experienced almost nine additional nights over 25 degrees that are attributable to climate change between 2018 and 2023. In Uttar Pradesh, Lakhimpur Kheri, Shahjahanpur and Varanasi also witnessed their highest recorded minimum temperatures at 33 degrees, 33 and 33.6 degrees respectively this week. Varanasi saw four additional nights over 25 degrees due to climate change from 2018 to 2023. These increasingly frequent extreme nighttime temperatures are contributing to heat stress, exhaustion and heat-related deaths. The current ongoing heatwave in India has been made hotter, frequent and more likely by climate change, according to scientific studies by World Weather Attribution and ClimaMeter. Roxy Mathew Koll, Climate Scientist, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, \"The urban heat island effect is most visible in the nighttime temperatures. Cities turn into urban heat islands when buildings, roads, and other infrastructure absorb and re-emit heat, causing cities to be several degrees hotter than surrounding rural areas.\" \"During the day, the sun's rays reach as shortwave radiation and heat the earth's surface. At night, the heat escapes as longwave radiation. While shortwave radiation can easily penetrate through and reach the surface, the longwave gets trapped easily by concrete and clouds.\" Aarti Khosla, Director, of Climate Trends, said, \"Like day temperatures, night temperatures have also shown constant and steady rise over the last few years. Warm nights have been punishing this summer with several cities shattering five decades of records. Cities will bear the highest brunt which will get worse due to the urban heat island effect.\" \"Several studies have already established that by the turn of the century, without very large reductions in fossil fuel burning, nighttime temperatures will not fall below 25 degrees in some places during hot weather impacting one's ability to recover for the next day. If we do not act now, nights will continue to be hotter, longer and sleepless, especially for the vulnerable.\"",

    "content": "The is studying the multi-story prisons in Chicago, China, and Singapore to finalize the blueprint for a highly anticipated high-rise prison in the Mankhurd area. This initiative aims to address overcrowding in various jails adjacent to Mumbai. According to official data, Maharashtra's prisons currently house 40,428 inmates, and the total capacity of the prison is 27,931. According to sources, a few months ago, the long-awaited 5-acre land in Mandala, was acquired by the state, and construction is likely to begin after discussions with the concerned department. \u201cCurrently, the projects in Palghar and Yerwada are at an advanced stage, and work on Mandala will start soon. This will help us reduce overcrowding in prisons across Maharashtra, which is currently higher than its actual capacity,\u201d said Amitabh Gupta, ADG Prison. ADVERTISEMENT The Maharashtra Housing Department, which will construct the prison on the 5-acre land in Mandala, is studying the blueprints of multi-story prisons worldwide, particularly those in China, Singapore, and Chicago. \"We are not accustomed to multi-story prisons, so it is crucial for us to understand how they function, how to handle inmates, provide various facilities, and move them within the facility. The construction will be different from a standard building, which is why we are studying blueprints from different prisons around the world,\" said an officer of the . The officials also said that they are also studying to use the full FSI or leave some open space for the sports facilities of the prisoners. As per the data, Maharashtra currently has 60 prisons which has a capacity of 27,931 inmates but it houses 40,428 inmates. As According to the data, prisons in Mumbai are also overcrowded, and many bail applications pending in courts are for non-serious offences. Official data shows that Arthur Road Jail in Mumbai, with a capacity of 999 inmates, houses 3,700. in Navi Mumbai has a capacity of 2,100 but holds 2,800 prisoners. Similarly, Thane Jail, with a capacity of 1,100, and Kalyan Jail, with a capacity of 505, accommodate 3,000 and 2,800 inmates, respectively. \u201cOvercrowding has been a serious concern in Mumbai, and we have been raising this issue with the concerned departments, including the legal department. Also, we need to ensure that bail is granted in cases involving non-serious offences. This would help create more space inside the prisons,\u201d an officer said on the condition of anonymity. \u201cIn non-serious cases, it is noticed that a huge amount of under-trials are languishing in jails. The norm of bail is the rule; jail is the exception, is unfortunately not being implemented in letter and spirit and the ground reality is a stark reminder. Corruption is rampant in Jails which is common knowledge. The Jails are hugely congested leading to fights even for crumbs. The Supreme Court has repeatedly expressed concern about the overcrowding of jails all over India. It is the duty of Courts, prosecutors and the concerned Government Authorities to conduct immediate surveys, jail which will reveal that hundreds of men and women are languishing for various reasons. The Trials are taking lots of years to even commence and it is the duty of all concerned to act swiftly as more the undertrial remains in the dangerous company even reform would be a remote dream, which is disastrous for our society also,\u201d said senior lawyer, Dr. Sujay Kantawala.",

    "description": "Summer Tokyo clash serves as warm up for New Zealand series as Steve Borthwick\u2019s side come up against former boss Eddie Jones",
    "content": "Sport | Rugby Union England warm up for New Zealand as they kick off their summer tour against Japan this weekend. Steve Borthwick\u2019s side have two tough clashes against the formidable All Blacks to come in Dunedin on July 6 and Auckland on July 13, but first they head to Tokyo for their first-ever rugby Test match against the Brave Blossoms on Japanese soil - scene of the 2019 World Cup, where they lost agonisingly to South Africa in the final in Yokohama. The presence of Eddie Jones back as Japan head coach adds another intriguing subplot to Saturday\u2019s showdown, with the former long-serving England boss having been confirmed in the role back in December only two months after resigning from Australia following a dismal World Cup campaign. England have named a strong side to face Japan and will want to make a statement in advance of that series in New Zealand, having followed up their shock run to the World Cup semi-finals in France in the autumn with an improved Six Nations performance in which they spoiled Ireland\u2019s dreams of back-to-backs Grand Slams before almost overcoming France in a last-day thriller in Paris. They also edged out early wins over Italy and Wales before being bested again by Scotland in the Calcutta Cup, having seen influential captain Owen Farrell stand down from international duty in a bid to prioritise his mental health. Japan - who also have Georgia and Italy on their summer schedule before a tricky autumn series in which they play New Zealand, France and England again, this time at Twickenham - beat Tonga last summer to go with losses to Samoa, Fiji and Italy, going on to finish third in their pool at the World Cup to ensure qualification for the 2027 tournament. The Brave Blossoms beat both Chile and Samoa, though lost to Argentina and fell to a scrappy 34-12 defeat by England in Nice , where Lewis Ludlam, Courtney Lawes, Freddie Steward and Joe Marchant all scored tries to go along with 14 points from the boot of George Ford. The one-off summer Test match between Japan and England takes place on Saturday June 22, 2024, with kick-off scheduled for 2:50pm local time - which is 6:50am BST in the UK. The game will be held at the Japan National Stadium in Tokyo. TV channel: Japan vs England will not be available to watch live on television in the UK, the first time in decades that a Red Rose international has not been broadcast on TV on these shores. Live stream: However, the game is available to watch online via RugbyPass TV - World Rugby\u2019s free online streaming platform.

Highlights and a full replay will be available via RugbyPass TV, while highlights will also be shown on the official England Rugby YouTube channel. Live blog: You can follow all the action as it happens live on Saturday with Standard Sport\u2019s live match blog. Jamie George captains England on tour for the first time, having been made skipper after Farrell\u2019s decision to step back from international duty. He leads a strong team in Tokyo, joined in the front row by Bevan Rodd and veteran tight-head Dan Cole. George Martin joins Maro Itoje at lock, with Chandler Cunningham-South earning a maiden Test start in the back row alongside new vice-skipper Ben Earl and Sam Underhill. Marcus Smith starts ahead of namesake Fin at fly-half with Farrell now ineligible for England duty as he prepares to join Racing 92 in France and Ford ruled out of the tour with an Achilles injury . George Furbank keeps his place at full-back with Steward not even on the bench, with Immanuel Feyi-Waboso and Tommy Freeman on the wings as Henry Slade partners Ollie Lawrence in midfield. Alex Mitchell is the starting scrum-half, backed up by Harry Randall instead of Ben Spencer. Sale wing Tom Roebuck is poised to earn his first senior England cap from the bench, where he is joined by fit-again Sharks team-mate Tom Curry. England are also without the likes of Ellis Genge this summer, with six uncapped players in the wider tour squad in Roebuck, Ollie Sleightholme, Fin Baxter, Luke Northmore, Gabriel Oghre and Joe Carpenter. Japan have named a very inexperienced team as Jones switches his attention to youth , with Waseda University student Yoshitaka Yazaki - who has yet to make his first-class debut - handed a shock start at full-back. Captain Michael Leitch, centre Dylan Riley and scrum-half Naoto Saito are the only three players starting who also began Japan\u2019s last World Cup game against Argentina in October. Japan XV: Yazaki; Naikabula, Riley, Osada, Nezuka; Lee, Sato; Mohara, Harada, Takeuchi; Waqa, Dearns; Leitch (c), Costley, Makisi Replacements: Sakate, Miura, Tamefusa, Saumaki, Yamamoto, Fujiwara, Matsuda, Tua England XV: Furbank; Feyi-Waboso, Slade, Lawrence, Freeman; M Smith, Mitchell; Rodd, George (c) Cole; Itoje, Martin; Cunningham-South, Underhill, Earl Replacements: Dan, Marler, Stuart, Ewels, T Curry, Randall, F Smith, Roebuck England have never previously lost to Japan in eight previous meetings between the two nations. Their most recent clash was at the Rugby World Cup in Nice last September, when England ran in four tries in a scrappy 34-12 pool stage victory. How England would love to get one over on old boss Jones this weekend. This is the first time they have come up against the outspoken Australian since he was sacked by RFU bosses following seven years in charge at Twickenham in December 2022. After an improved Six Nations and impressive World Cup that busted all expectations that had sunk so low after such a woeful summer, England have to keep evolving and building under Borthwick in another new cycle. They are missing a lot of experience this summer both in terms of retired players, overseas absentees and injuries, but rugby challenges do not come much tougher than battling the All Blacks in New Zealand and it is essential they have the best possible preparations if they are to spring a shock in the Land of the Long White Cloud next month. That starts with what has to be a commanding win over a Japan team beginning a new era with Jones back at the helm, provided they cope with what are expected to be extremely hot and humid conditions in Tokyo. England to win by at least 15 points. Japan to win: 11/1 England to win: 1/20 Draw: 50/1 Odds via Betfair (subject to change).

    "description": "\u2018It always amazes me how many people do this.\u2019",
    "content": "A professional cleaner has spotted a \u201cstressful\u201d detail in almost every renter\u2019s home before they move out. Kacie Stephens walks through thousands of properties every year to do a regular service or a once-off end-of-lease clean. One of the most common things she has noticed during bond cleaning services is that tenants often don\u2019t move their personal belongings out of the home until the day they must return the keys. Know the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today \u201cHow does a professional cleaner handle walking into a \u2018move-out clean\u2019 or end-of-lease clean, and the client has not quite moved out?\u201d the Melbourne cleaner said in a video. \u201cBecause this happens quite often... It always amazes me how many people leave everything to the very last day of a tenancy: removalist, cleaners, keys back and more. \u201cThat is the most stressful way to do it.\u201d During one of her latest jobs, Stephens was hired to do a \u201cbachelor pad\u201d end-of-lease clean. \u201cI think it wasn\u2019t too bad, other than they hadn\u2019t quite finished moving out,\u201d she said, laughing. The video shows a kitchen with cookware on the stove, rubbish strewn over the benchtops and canned foods, condiments and staples left untouched in the walk-in pantry. Before a professional cleaner arrives to do the major task, tenants are expected to move everything out. The business owner of The Big Clean Co cleaning service has urged renters to give themselves at least one day between when the removalist comes and when the keys go back to the real estate agent or landlord. She says giving yourself time will allow you to prepare for any unexpected things and to ensure you have \u201cdone absolutely everything you need to do\u201d before moving out. When a professional cleaner arrives at a property and it\u2019s nowhere near ready for end-of-lease cleaning, Stephens says she usually offers the client three options. \u201cOne: Client pays more money immediately for the cleaner to take it all out of the house. \u201cTwo: The cleaner can start on another area while the client moves it themselves. \u201cThree: The cleaner can push most of it to the side and go around it.\u201d Stephens previously shared an end-of-lease cleaning guide to help tenants get their full bond back after moving out. \u201cMoving out of a rental? Here are the top five things that property managers have hawk eyes for that you can complete before move out day. It\u2019s drilled into our brains to not miss these things,\u201d she said. One of the places renters always forget to deep clean are the window tracks. \u201cProperty managers are obsessed with window tracks,\u201d she said. \u201cThe best way to clean window tracks is to vacuum the excess out (using a small attachment), then place a cloth over the end of a toothbrush to clean.\u201d She has urged tenants to remove the hidden soap scum, mould or rust stains in the edges around the shower screen. Stephens says ovens are often neglected. \u201cUse a toothbrush to get into the corners of the oven,\u201d she explained, adding that ovens require a deep clean inside and out. The cleaner suggested you need to soak the \u201cgreasy\u201d cook top knobs, if they come off, in soapy water \u2014 and ensure you thoroughly clean the area. Other places to clean include exhaust fans and ceiling fans, as they collect a lot of dust over time. Sign up to the 7NEWS app here - the news you want, when you need it. Download now, for free .",

    "description": "Keep up to date with the latest updates, signings, gossip and rumours from the summer transfer window",
    "content": "Sport | Football Transfer news LIVE! Arsenal are hoping to make the first major breakthrough of the summer transfer window with a deal for a new striker. Reports in Portugal claim a deal for Sporting CP striker Viktor Gyokeres is close, so it\u2019ll be interesting to see if that is backed up today. Victor Osimhen and Santiago Gimenez have also been touted as targets. Over at Chelsea , a swap deal is being pushed for Michael Olise which would see Trevoh Chalobah move to Crystal Palace. Fulham are also in the mix for Chalobah . The Blues are set to sell Ian Maatsen to Aston Villa and have also been linked with Argentine defender Aaron Anselmino and Jhon Duran. Tottenham remain in the hunt for Chelsea midfielder Conor Gallagher, now a target for Arsenal, with Ivan Toney and Ricardo Calafiori on their radar. Like Arsenal, Manchester United want a new striker with Jonathan David and Joshua Zirkzee their top priority. Follow all the latest transfer news, rumours and gossip live below! Latest transfer news and rumours Live updates Chelsea are formulating a swap deal to sign Michael Olise. Trevoh Chalobah, who Standard Sport reported yesterday is a target for Fulham, is said by GiveMeSport to be on offer to Crystal Palace. Olise was claimed recently to have agreed personal terms with Chelsea and has a release clause in the region of \u00a360m. However, it is said to be complex and involve a sell-on fee direct to the player. Therefore, Palace may prefer to negotiate and Chelsea hope to make in-roads with Chalobah as a makeweight. Reports yesterday of a new contract proposal from the Eagles to Olise have also been dismissed. It has been claimed that Arsenal are in advanced talks to sign Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting CP. That\u2019s according to Portuguese outlet Leonino as the Gunners look to land a new striker for next season. The Swede is said to have an \u00a386m release clause so it\u2019ll be interesting to learn more about this supposed deal. It\u2019s safe to say that fans in Lisbon have brushed off this report as nothing substantial. Sporting, for their part, want Panathinaikos attacker Fotis Ioannidis as Gyokeres\u2019 replacement. That\u2019s a rumour that has been doing the rounds far and wide. Manchester United have been given a boost in their pursuit of Joshua Zirkzee. According to Italian journalist Nick Semeraro, the Bologna striker\u2019s agent, Kia Joorabchian, has dropped his demands from \u00a312.5m to \u00a38m for United. AC Milan are still in the race, but must pay Joorabcian\u2019s full rate. Zirkzee has a \u00a334m release clause. Tottenham and Liverpool appear to be engaged in a transfer battle over Riccardo Calafiori. The Bologna defender is attracting rave reviews early in his career and already has three senior international caps for Italy, with some - including ex-England boss Fabio Capello - already dubbing him as the new Sergio Ramos. Italian publication Il Bianconero report that Spurs could jump ahead of Juventus in the queue by launching a bid for Calafiori, while Liverpool are also now being linked with the 22-year-old. Manchester United will end their interest in Jarrad Branthwaite if Everton are unwilling to negotiate. That's according to ESPN, who report that United are yet to increase their opening offer of \u00a335m plus \u00a38m add-ons - which was dismissed immediately by Everton. The Toffees are demanding at least \u00a370m, which United will not pay. Fulham have revived their transfer interest in Chelsea defender Trevoh Chalobah, writes Dom Smith . The centre-back is one of several players who could leave Stamford Bridge this summer. Chalobah has four years left on his contract but, as an academy graduate, would count as pure profit in any sale as Chelsea bid to ensure that they stay in line with Premier League profit and sustainability rules. After missing the first six months of last season with a hamstring injury, Chalobah impressed at the end of the campaign and Fulham, who considered signing him last summer, have now renewed their interest. Read more here! Arsenal \"very close\" to sealing a deal for Sporting striker Viktor Gyokeres. That's according to Portuguese outfit Leonino, who claims Mikel Arteta has picked his preferred striker target and the club are now moving quickly to wrap up the signing. There is no word of a free, but the former Coventry striker has been touted at around \u00a350-60m this summer after 43 goals and adding a futher 15 assists in 50 appearances for Sporting last season. More now on Chelsea\u2019s apparent transfer interest in Aaron Anselmino. Reports from Argentina this week have claimed that the Blues lodged a \u00a313.3m bid with Boca Juniors for their teenage defender. Fabrizio Romano now claims that Chelsea do indeed have \u201cgenuine interest\u201d in Anselmo and are aware of what it will take to land his signature. He says there has been no offer yet, but a close eye is being kept on developments around the 19-year-old. Arsenal look to be battling Borussia Dortmund for the signing of Ferdi Kadioglu. The Gunners have previously been linked more than once with the versatile Turkey full-back, who plies his club trade with Fenerbahce. Dortmund are said to have made contact over a move for Kadioglu, though Ajan Sport in Turkey claim that Arsenal have tabled an offer of \u20ac20m. Manchester United look to have received a timely boost in their pursuit of Joshua Zirkzee. The Dutch international forward, a late injury call-up to the Netherlands squad for Euro 2024, is known to be high on the list of potential attacking reinforcements this summer at Old Trafford. However, United have faced plenty of rival interest in Zirkzee, including from the likes of Arsenal, Liverpool and AC Milan. But according to reports in Italy cited by Football Transfers, AC Milan are no longer considered as the front runners for Zirkzee and could now move for free agent Memphis Depay instead.

    "content": "Indian CEOs are prioritising technology investment, including artificial intelligence (AI) but stay guarded amid data security challenges, according to a report. Around 70 per cent of CEOs are channeling investments into technology, including AI, to catalyse growth and enhance productivity over the next 12 months, which is much higher than their global counterpart at 47 per cent, according to the 'EY CEO Outlook Pulse Survey'. However, fortifying data management and cybersecurity (56 per cent) and pursuing cost optimisation across business facets (50 per cent) also stand out as critical strategic imperatives in the near term. Moreover, the acquisition of technology, new production capabilities, or innovative startups (44 per cent) emerges as the leading strategic driver for mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activities, said the report. \"Commitment to tech investments is not just a response to the present but a strategic leap towards the future. The survey underscores this momentum, revealing that a substantial majority of CEOs are actively aligning their organisations with an AI-centric blueprint for innovation and productivity,\" said Mahesh Makhija, EY India Technology Consulting Leader. Despite a majority of CEOs acknowledging the growing importance of sustainability compared to a year ago, there is a trend of sustainability slipping down the priority list for almost 16 per cent of CEOs, overshadowed by financial constraints and a shift in boardroom focus. To bolster the sustainability agenda, corporate India advocates for technology incentives, including AI, as well as subsidies and tax breaks for green technology investments, coupled with governmental backing of sustainable infrastructure projects.",

    "description": "\u2018She\u2019s going to be sadly missed.\u2019",
    "content": "A shocked Queensland community has rallied around two girls after a woman was allegedly shot dead in front of them in her car by a neighbour. Tributes have poured in for Natalie Frahm after the 34-year-old was killed in the driveway of her Mackay home on Wednesday afternoon. Frahm was in the car preparing to leave for a sporting activity when she was allegedly shot by Ryan Geoffrey Cole, with the girls in the back seat. Know the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today Cole, 31, is also accused of shooting a good Samaritan after the girls \u2014 aged 11 and 12 \u2014 escaped the vehicle and raised the alarm. James McGill, 66, was visiting his elderly mother who lived nearby when he came to Frahm\u2019s aid after the girls asked for help. He suffered hand and chest injuries after allegedly being shot by Cole, but is in a stable condition in hospital following surgery. Cole was a neighbour but did not know Frahm , police said, and a motive for the alleged attacks is yet to be established. \u201cWe\u2019re working really hard to look into the background of Mr Cole ... To find out what his movements were prior to the incident and afterwards so we can establish what may have been a contributing factor,\u201d Detective Acting Superintendent Emma Novosel said on Friday. \u201cAs you can imagine, this is a complex investigation. We\u2019re going to be really methodical about how we go trying to determine what the cause was.\u201d A revolver-style gun believed to have been allegedly used by Cole to murder Frahm has not been found, Novosel said. Nicholas Vanderzee, the owner of Mang Gon Thai Boxing and a friend of Frahm, said Frahm never mentioned her neighbour and alleged killer Cole. Vanderzee said Frahm was a dedicated and beloved member of the club who started in the sport almost two years ago when her son joined. \u201cShe used to come and drop him off and she would watch. She quite liked what she saw,\u201d he told 7NEWS. \u201cWe encourage parents to jump in and start training. There\u2019s nothing better than a parent training with heir children. \u201cShe started and absolutely fell in love with Muay Thai ... Loved the training, loved to get pushed, she what she was capable of doing.\u201d Vanderzee said he was \u201clost for words\u201d when he was told of Frahm\u2019s \u201cgut-wrenching\u201d death. \u201cShe was a beautiful person. Absolutely beautiful person. She had the beautiful smile and was just such a pleasant being,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s going to be sadly missed.\u201d The club also set up a GoFundMe fundraiser for the girls, with more than $9000 already pledged on Friday. Mackay Mayor Greg Williamson said the community is \u201creeling\u201d at the \u201crandom, outrageous act of violence\u201d. Frahm\u2019s parents have flown in from Mount Isa, with floral tributes starting to arrive outside her South Mackay home. Support has been provided to the two girls as the South Mackay community also tries to process the incident. \u201cThe two young girls who were in the back of the car and ran off to get help are going to live with this for the rest of their lives,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a grieving process which will take a fair while to work out ... but over the next few days the community will rally.\u201d The mayor hailed the bravery of the girls as well as McGill who approached the alleged gunman after answering their calls for help. \u201cHow good was that? It\u2019s a typical Australian reaction, I think \u2014 you go in and help,\u201d he said. Cole is accused of shooting Frahm and McGill before driving away, sparking an emergency lockdown and police manhunt. He was later arrested at a nearby service station and was charged with murder and attempted murder on Thursday. Police are investigating how Cole allegedly gained access to a firearm after having a weapons licence revoked three years ago. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a single person in Queensland whose heart doesn\u2019t break for Natalie and her family and friends,\u201d Queensland Police Minister Mark Ryan said. \u201cIt\u2019ll always be impossible to rationalise the decision-making of a monster. \u201cThis person had firearms illegally. His weapons licence had been cancelled. Police had taken those weapons off him. \u201cPart of the investigation will look at how he might\u2019ve come into possession of this illegal firearm ... but that work, we\u2019ve got to allow police to do.\u201d Cole was remanded in custody as his matter was mentioned in Mackay Magistrates Court on Friday, to be next heard in July.",

    "description": "Beachside holidays are all but ruled out during the colder seasons but don\u2019t deny yourself an inland escape.",
    "content": "It\u2019s no secret that my fiance\u0301 and I are huge fans of the beach, after all we live within a stone\u2019s throw distance of Australia\u2019s most famous stretch of sand \u2014 Bondi. So when it comes to spending time abroad or simply away from our local haunts we often still choose areas that are close to the coast where we can prioritise surfing, paddleboarding, camping and hiking, a view of the water always within sight. And while we\u2019ve done a fairly good job over the years of ticking off Australia\u2019s most prized spans of ocean, winter brings with it a new challenge of finding somewhere relaxing \u2014 but warm \u2014 to enjoy together. Know the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today So with Virgin Australia announcing new flight routes from Melbourne and Brisbane straight to Uluru, we decided to tick off a bucket list holiday destination as far away from the coast as possible \u2014 and we did it all in a long weekend. From Sydney we travelled through to Melbourne, which only takes an hour, and then almost immediately onto Uluru\u2019s tiny desert airport , making the travel day to the Red Centre one of the shortest flights I\u2019ve been on. Upon landing my partner shuffled straight up to the Hertz desk to pick up a mammoth Toyota Prado 4x4 which would then make getting around the town of Yulara and onto the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park a breeze. I can\u2019t recommend the team enough for swiftly organising our car rental but if you do decide to book in tours by themselves there is a free airport shuttle bus that will take you to your nearby hotel. We stayed at Sails in the Desert , a luxury five-star resort mere moments away from all of the action and with its own swimming pool, bars, eateries and enormous rooms. The best thing about booking through Voyages Ayers Rock Resort is that you can lock in your accommodation, dinners and tours all in the one place, so you can focus on relaxation and romance in the desert. I started with a 60-minute massage at the award-winning Red Ochre spa which is actually about a one minute walk from the outside of our room. It\u2019s so easy to forget the little luxuries when life is on the go at home so taking the time to lay down and be pampered was a welcome addition to the trip. Once we had explored our room \u2014 TWO beds, a shower that could fit an entire family and a deck overlooking the pool \u2014 we got ready for our first night out at Arnguli Grill. This eatery is actually in the neighbouring hotel Desert Gardens but you can walk there from Sails in the Desert, which is just as well because you\u2019re going to want to enjoy a bottle of wine together. Not only was the service extremely accommodating \u2014 my partner has a serious nut allergy \u2014 but the food was beyond delicious, with the steaks their speciality. We actually spoke to a young couple also enjoying their time at Arnguli who said it was one of the best restaurants they\u2019d ever been to, so we weren\u2019t the only ones heaping praise on it. And while our dinner was first class I\u2019d be remiss for not mentioning just how scrumptious the following morning\u2019s buffet breakfast was at Sails in the Desert. Whether you\u2019re in the market for a traditional Full English, cereal, yoghurt, fruit, a salad, dumplings, pancakes or simply an egg omelette we were overwhelmed by the choices and had at least three servings a piece. While there is a supermarket in Yulara, the town with which the Ayers Rock Resort postings are situated, I can\u2019t recommend dining in at the hotels enough \u2014 particularly if you\u2019re preparing for a big day ahead. With the added benefit of having a hire car to zip around in, Charlie and I decided to do the Valley of the Winds walk at Kata Tjuta during our stay. Winter is the perfect time to go on a hike in the national park because the weather tops the mid-20s range, so you\u2019ll never be sweating too profusely or requiring more than a few litres of water at a time. We also ended up walking around the base of Uluru itself, which took us about three hours to complete. Hiring a pushbike or segway while you\u2019re there is also a good way to take in the enormity of what\u2019s surrounding you but we found it equally as peaceful to walk hand in hand through the sand. When it came to choosing dinner on our second and final night there were options galore. To absolutely treat you and your partner, the Tali Wiru experience is like no other, with a four-hour degustation-style menu paired with Penfolds wines and stargazing on the agenda. But we opted for the Field of Light dinner so we could see the magic 50,000-strong light installation alongside a three-course bush tucker inspired buffet. You watch the sun set over Uluru with a glass of sparkling wine in hand before eating and drinking alongside a host of tourists and other Australians combined. When the sun completely sets you get the opportunity to explore the Field of Light up close \u2014 which is constantly being maintained and upheld because of its popularity \u2014 before a bus drops you back to the hotel. The Ayers Rock Resort is extremely family friendly \u2014 there were kids at the hotel and on many of the tours \u2014 but even they understand the importance of Uluru and its surrounds so that doesn\u2019t hampen the romantic experience. While we may not have seen an ocean the gorges surrounding Uluru were enough of a water fix to make us second guess why we hadn\u2019t travelled inland sooner.

    "content": "Cherie Clonan, CEO of marketing agency The Digital Picnic, explains how perks like free dinners, burnout-preventing days off and even ADHD assessments have boosted employee wellbeing – and her bottom line. If you walk into the offices of The Digital Picnic (TDP) in Melbourne, Australia, there's a high probability that there won't be a single person there. While an empty office might not sound like the setting for one of Australia's most radically inclusive businesses, it's just one of many policies that has led to this small digital marketing agency being described by their clients as \"the nicest place on the internet\", according to Cherie Clonan, the company's founder and CEO. At TDP, there are only six in-office days per month, on Mondays and Thursdays. The first week of each month is entirely work from home, with minimal meetings and nothing client-facing. If employees can't face even those few days in the office, they have the option to work remotely all the time. \"We just want to get the best out of people and not chip away at their soul in order to get that,\" Clonan tells the BBC.Clonan, who was recently named Woman of the Year in the B&T Women in Media awards for her human-centred and inclusive approach to leadership, is firmly focussed on transforming workplace culture. As a proudly autistic leader, she has a unique lens on neuro-affirming work practices, centred around flexibility, empathy and accommodation, where the mental health of her team is a core focus.\"[Mental health] has never been more important,\" says Clonan, who explains her priority is to foster a culture where employees can be open about their mental health without fear of stigma or judgment. \"I don't think we're actually well as a society, off the back of some pretty big years where it was all a lot for a long time. It's more important now than ever for organisational leaders to prioritise mental health beyond a cupcake once a year.\"It's more important now than ever for organisational leaders to prioritise mental health beyond a cupcake once a year – Cherie Clonan Mental health is increasingly being recognised as a crucial factor in workplace productivity and employee well-being. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), mental health conditions like depression and anxiety cost the global economy $1tn (£780bn) annually in lost productivity. And psychological well-being is now a high priority for workers too. The American Psychological Association's 2023 Work in America Survey noted, for example, that 92% of employees surveyed said that it is \"very\" or \"somewhat important\" to them to work for an organisation that values their emotional and psychological well-being.",

    "content": "An bug has taken voice line spamming to new levels of annoying, letting players blast out the eardrums of anyone in the lobby regardless of which team you\u2019re on. Overwatch 2 is finally here, and it brings with it a fair amount of new content. From a new limited-time game mode to Push getting some big additions with Runasapi and a newly , and there\u2019s even once again. It\u2019s a jam-packed season, though not all has gone according to plan out of the gate. With the , a handful of bugs have slipped through the cracks, than others. Already in the new patch, players have found quite a hilarious bug, as voice line spamming can now be heard across the server, transcending team barriers. The new Kiriko \"Not good enough\" voice line is bugged the ENTIRE lobby can hear it as if I'm Infront of them oh no... Spotted by Twitch streamer , she discovered that the new Kiriko voice line \u2013 which you can get in the Season 11 Battle Pass \u2013 \u201cnot good enough\u201d, can be spammed and heard by everyone in the server, even if the spawn barriers aren\u2019t down. As it would turn out, it isn\u2019t just Kiriko causing the issue. All new voice lines for every hero in Season 11 are affected by the bug, meaning you can distract your opponents (and also your teammates) anytime, from anywhere. As you can imagine, it\u2019s led to an uptick in voice line spam. In Phyerx\u2019s clip, she showed her opponent\u2019s point of view where we can see them being distracted by the mysterious voice line spam, to the point they were afraid to leave their spawn. If you have a player in your lobby either abusing this bug, or voiceline spamming in general, you can mute all text and hero comms by going to the social channels, right-clicking on the player profile, and selecting the option. As for when a fix for it is coming out, there\u2019s no quite telling. Though at the time of writing voice lines in in the Battle Pass have been disabled as a temporary fix so players don\u2019t completely take over lobbies.",

    "description": "William has faced a challenging 12 months with both his wife the Princess of Wales and father the King diagnosed with cancer",
    "content": "News | UK The Prince of Wales is celebrating his 42nd birthday \u2013 the day after watching England \u2019s disappointing Euro 2024 draw against Denmark . William, president of the FA, was pictured alongside Denmark\u2019s King Frederick as the two teams went head to head in Frankfurt , Germany , with the Three Lions drawing 1-1 in their second match of the tournament. William has faced a challenging 12 months with both his wife the Princess of Wales and father the King diagnosed with cancer. His birthday came amid speculation the future king supports his father\u2019s slimmed-down approach to the monarchy and that William may not want his younger children Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis to be working royals. The Daily Mail\u2019s Richard Eden wrote that a friend of the prince told him: \u201cWhen the older members of the family retire, His Royal Highness won\u2019t be inviting anyone else to become working royals. \u201cIt remains to be seen if he will even want his two younger children to be working royals.\u201d Ten-year-old Prince George is a future king, but third in line Charlotte, aged nine, and fourth in line Louis, six, are spares to the heir and, therefore, not expected to ever reign as monarch. Kate returned briefly to the public limelight at Trooping the Colour last weekend with William and their three children. But in a personal message to the nation, the princess revealed although she is making good progress, she is \u201cnot out of the woods yet\u201d. Kate told how she has good days and bad days and is facing a few more months of chemotherapy treatment. How to watch England vs South Africa: TV channel and live stream Give people reason for hope rather than alarm on social care, say sector leaders GPs \u2018struggle to find work as patients left in pain\u2019 \u2013 union Share your cat or dog's joyful moment to win William was seen with his mother-in-law Carole Middleton this week on a day out at Royal Ascot , where he took to a carriage with his stepmother the Queen for the traditional procession along the course. Prince William Arthur Philip Louis of Wales was born second in line to the throne at St Mary\u2019s Hospital, Paddington, at 9.03pm on June 21 1982. He weighed 7lb 1 1/2oz and was the first-born son of the then-Prince and the Princess of Wales. At just nine months old, he accompanied his parents on a six-week official visit to Australia and New Zealand, which was a break from tradition with royal babies usually left at home in the care of nannies. His mother Diana , who separated from the then-Prince of Wales in 1992, died in a car crash in Paris in 1997. William was just 15 and his brother Prince Harry 12, and the boys walked behind the princess\u2019s coffin during a funeral procession through London. The prince met Kate Middleton at St Andrews University in Fife, and the pair married at Westminster Abbey in 2011 after dating for more than eight years. They welcomed their first child George in 2013, followed by Charlotte in 2015, and then Louis in 2018. After the death of the late Queen in 2022, the King announced in his first historic address that he had made William and Kate the new Prince and Princess of Wales. William has a long-running rift with his brother the Duke of Sussex, with no sign yet of a reconciliation. The fallout originated ahead of Harry\u2019s wedding to Meghan Markle, now the Duchess of Sussex, and worsened after the accusations Harry publicly levelled at his brother in his double tell-alls: his Netflix documentary and his memoir Spare. When their joint friend the Duke of Westminster married in Chester Cathedral earlier this month, William acted as an usher, but Harry mutually agreed with the groom that he would not attend. Since his last birthday, William has launched Homewards, his five-year drive to eradicate homelessness in six locations around the UK. His other key focuses include raising mental health awareness, and the Earthshot Prize, his \u00a350 million environmental competition to find solutions to help the planet.

    "content": "From empanadas and mock meats to bulk soy sauce and beer on tap: what don\u2019t Melbourne\u2019s new-wave delis and grocers sell? June 21, 2024 You have reached your maximum number of saved items. Remove items from your saved list to add more. Save this article for later Add articles to your saved list and come back to them anytime. Thinking small is the biggest trend in food shopping right now. Small-batch curry paste. Small eco-footprint toilet roll. And, most noticeably, small and independent grocers where staff will pack your items, choose what goes on the shelves, and probably even make your toasted sandwich. The corner shop is reinventing itself for a contemporary crowd. \u201cWe\u2019re putting the petrol in the car again,\u201d says Mark Fine, referring to the way petrol station attendants used to fill up customers\u2019 cars. The former sports broadcaster has revamped Caulfield North institution Lenny\u2019s with wife Natalie, bringing the 25-year-old Jewish deli into the \u201cdesigner deli\u201d era. \u201cIt really is a feast for eyes and that\u2019s what a deli is these days,\u201d he says. But the Fines have held on to a few old ideas that are finding new currency: exceptional customer service, hands-on owners, and home-style cooking. At Stanley Street Bodega in Collingwood, great coffee meets convenience store in a densely populated pocket of the suburb. \u201cAsian convenience stores just fascinate me ... I can spend a long time in there,\u201d says owner Eddie Inostroza. Believing that \u201cevery country\u2019s got its own style of convenience store\u201d, he\u2019s created his own interpretation, combining his career running cafes, his Chilean heritage, and the things nearby apartment-dwellers seek out, such as wine and fancy potato chips. Of course, Melbourne\u2019s never been short of top-of-the-range food shops. A1 Bakery on Sydney Road is legendary, there are Euro delis galore at our markets, and dotting the suburbs are beacons such as Richmond\u2019s Greek stalwart Laikon , Malvern butcher-deli Lewis & Son and, until recently, Italian specialist Enoteca Sileno . The next generation is picking up these ideas and running with them, adding even more niche specialty items and high-quality food to eat there or nearby. Lenny\u2019s Fine Foods The blintzes, chicken soup and gefilte fish are still there. But the revamped Lenny\u2019s \u2013 a neighbourhood institution for more than 20 years \u2013 packs in much more than your average Jewish deli. There\u2019s even a vegan version of its famous chicken soup. Come for ready-to-heat dinners such as green curry or lamb shank and barley soup, or a takeaway bagel bursting with beef brisket, made by co-owner Mark Fine. Brightly painted timber walls inlaid with backlit signage steer you towards smoked and cured fish (including 12 kinds of herring), treats such as Basque cheesecake, golden schnitzels and American deli faves such as wedge salad. 636 Inkerman Road, Caulfield North, instagram.com/lennys_fine_food Stanley Street Bodega In love with the high-quality convenience stores of Asia and the bodegas of New York, owner Eddie Inostroza created his own version in the thick of Collingwood\u2019s forest of apartments. The retail edit is small but smart. Canned tomatoes, eggs and St David\u2019s Dairy yoghurt will get you out of tight spots, plus there\u2019s fun stuff like Chappy\u2019s chips and fancy peanut butter. Toasties and pastries are the main fare but there are also chicken and chorizo empanadas from Chilean food shop Two Chiles in Windsor. All about community, it\u2019s open later than many cafes (hello, 5pm espresso and beer on tap) and is also extremely dog-friendly. R1, 72 Stanley Street, Collingwood, stanleystreetbodega.com Ima Pantry This is the corner shop many neighbourhoods would kill for. From the same owners as hit Japanese cafe Ima Asa/Yoru , this is a treasure trove of artisan soy sauce, yuzu kosho , Melbourne-made curry pastes, potato chips and kimchi, vegetables (all in season of course) and just about anything else you might need, including toilet roll.

    "description": "The Office for National Statistics notes the prices of individual goods and services alongside the consumer prices index - with a number of items rising in price",
    "content": "Supermarket-goers are being warned about the bottles of in their kitchen, as it has emerged to be one of the major contributors to UK's inflation rate. Indeed, shoppers would be staggered to know that prices of various items have spiked significantly. Travel down the food aisle and you'll find that price tags for individual goods and services are far higher than they were three years ago, before inflation saw food prices jump by at least a quarter. Among the Office for National Statistics list of price rises, Olive oil has seen a staggering increase, rising by 39.1 per cent. Meanwhile sugar has risen seven per cent, vegetables 2.5 per cent, eggs 2.5 per cent, fruit 2.6 per cent and ready-made meals 3.8 per cent. Take a detour to beverage section and you'll see cocoa and powdered chocolate price is up 19.5 per cent. While juices from fruits and vegetables show an increase of 1.6 per cent, mineral or spring waters see a surge of 4.5 per cent, reports . Tea bags too aren't spared, recording a massive 9.8 per cent surplus cost while soft drinks have recorded 3.4 per cent rise. As for the booze lovers, beer has risen by 5.6 per cent, wine by 6.2 per cent and spirits by 5.7 per cent. Not all news initiates a panicked dash to the supermarket. As it turns out, The Office of National Statistics (ONS) announced that inflation has slid to its lowest since July 2021. This implies that while prices continue to rise, the pace is slower. The biggest \"downward trend\" was reported in the food sector with prices of food and non-alcoholic drinks rising by just 1.7 per cent in the year to May, a decrease from 2.9 per cent in April. This drop in pace is the lowest recorded from October 2021 and is a significant ease from the staggering 14-month peak of 19.2 per cent in March last year, which was the highest annual rate recorded for more than 45 years. The ONS has verified that the annual rates of inflation have eased off for nine of the 11 food and non-alcoholic beverage categories within the period of 12 months to May 2024. According to the figures released on Wednesday (June 19), the ONS stated that prices actually saw a decrease between April 2024 and May 2024, in contrast to the monthly increase observed the previous year.",

    "description": "Seoul is considering sending lethal weapons to Kyiv after Russia and North Korea signed a mutual defence pact.",
    "content": "Vladimir Putin has warned South Korea it would be making \"a big mistake\" if it arms Ukraine in the war against Russia. His comments come after Seoul said it was considering such a possibility, in response to Russia and North Korea's new pact to help each other in the event of \"aggression\" against either country . Moscow \"will... [make] decisions which are unlikely to please the current leadership of South Korea\" if Seoul decides to supply arms to Kyiv, Mr Putin told reporters on Thursday. The Russian leader was speaking in Vietnam, shortly after a lavish visit to Pyongyang where he signed a mutual defence agreement with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Seoul had earlier condemned the agreement as a threat to its national security, and national security adviser Chang Ho-jin said his country planned to \"reconsider the issue of arms support to Ukraine\". Following Mr Putin's remarks, South Korea's presidential office said on Friday it would consider \"various options\" in supplying arms to Ukraine and its stance will \"depend on how Russia approaches this issue\". Authorities are also expected to summon Russia's ambassador to South Korea to lodge a protest, Yonhap news agency reported citing unnamed diplomatic sources. While South Korea has given humanitarian aid and military equipment to Ukraine, it has so far refused to provide lethal weapons as it has an official policy not to arm countries at war. Some in Ukraine have been hoping that the deepening military collaboration between Moscow and Pyongyang would cause Seoul to rethink its approach. Analysts had earlier said that Kyiv would use Mr Putin's visit to Pyongyang to up the pressure. During the visit, Mr Kim had also pledged \"full support\" for Russia's invasion of Ukraine. There is growing evidence that Russia has already been deploying North Korean missiles in Ukraine . Early on Friday the US national security council's spokesman John Kirby weighed in on the Russian-North Korean agreement, saying it should \"be of concern to any country that cares about maintaining peace and stability\" in the region. He added that the agreement was \"no surprise\", saying that the US had been warning about the two countries' \"burgeoning defence relationship\" for many months. Tokyo said it was \u201cseriously concerned that President Putin did not rule out military technology co-operation with North Korea\u201d, Japan's government spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi said, adding that the agreement was \"unacceptable\". Analysts have said that the treaty could have significant implications for the world as well as the region. Besides the possibility of North Korean openly arming Russia, it could also potentially see Russia intervening in any fresh conflict on the Korean peninsula. The two Koreas are still technically at war and maintain a heavily guarded border, where tensions have worsened in recent weeks. In a separate incident on Thursday, North Korean troops \"briefly crossed\" the border and retreated after the South fired warning shots, Seoul authorities said on Friday. This marks the third such incident in less than three weeks. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff had said the two earlier cases - on 9 June and 18 June - appeared to be unintentional .

    "content": "BARCELONA, Spain (AP) \u2014 Try saying \u201cno\u201d when a child asks for a smartphone. What comes after, parents everywhere can attest, begins with some variation of: \u201cEveryone has one. Why can\u2019t I?\u201d But what if no pre-teen in sight has one \u2014 and what if having a smartphone was weird? That\u2019s the endgame of an increasing number of parents across Europe who are concerned by evidence that smartphone use among young kids \u2014 and share the conviction that there\u2019s strength in numbers. From Spain to Britain and Ireland, parents are flooding WhatsApp and Telegram groups with plans not just to keep smartphones out of schools, but to link arms and refuse to buy young kids the devices before \u2014 or even into \u2014 their teenage years. After being inspired by a conversation in a Barcelona park with other moms, Elisabet Garci\u0301a Permanyer started a chat group last fall to share information on the perils of Internet access for children with families at her kids\u2019 school. The group, called \u201cAdolescence Free of Mobile Phones,\u201d quickly expanded to other schools and then across the entire country to now include over 10,000 members. The most engaged parents have formed pairs of activists in schools across Spain and are pushing for fellow parents to agree not to get their kids smartphones until they are 16. After organizing online, they facilitate real-world talks among concerned parents to further their crusade. \u201cWhen I started this, I just hoped I would find four other families who thought like me, but it took off and kept growing, growing and growing,\u201d Garci\u0301a Permanyer says. \u201cMy goal was to try to join forces with other parents so we could push back the point when smartphones arrive. I said, \u2018I am going to try so that my kids are not the only ones who don\u2019t have one.\u2019\u201d A push, with the help of Spain\u2019s government It isn\u2019t just parents. Police and public health experts were sounding the alarm about a spike of violent and pornographic videos being witnessed by children via handheld devices. Spain\u2019s government took note of the momentum and banned smartphones entirely from elementary schools in January. Now they can only be turned on in high school, which starts at age 12, if a teacher deems it necessary for an educational activity. \u201cIf we adults are addicted to smartphones, how can we give one to a 12-year-old who doesn\u2019t have the ability to handle it?\u201d Garci\u0301a Permanyer asks. \u201cThis has gotten away from us. If the Internet were a safe space for children, then it would be fine. But it isn\u2019t.\u201d The movement in Britain gained steam this year after the mother of 16-year-old Brianna Ghey, who was killed by two teenagers last year, began demanding that kids under 16 be blocked from accessing social media on smartphones. \u201cIt feels like we all know (buying smartphones) is a bad decision for our kids, but that the social norm has not yet caught up,\u201d Daisy Greenwell, a Suffolk, England-area mother of three kids under age 10, posted to her Instagram earlier this year. \u201cWhat if we could switch the social norm so that in our school, our town, our country, it was an odd choice to make to give your child a smartphone at 11? What if we could hold off until they\u2019re 14, or 16?\u201d She and a friend, Clare Reynolds, set up a WhatsApp group called Parents United for a Smartphone-Free Childhood, with three people on it. She posted an invitation on her Instagram page. Within four days, 2,000 people had joined the group, requiring Greenwell and Reynolds to split off dozens of groups by locality. Three weeks after the original post, there was a chat group for every British county, one of the organizers said on WhatsApp. It\u2019s an uphill climb Parents rallying to ban smartphones from young children have a long way to go to change what\u2019s considered \u201cnormal.\u201d By the time they\u2019re 12, most children have smartphones, statistics from all three countries show. Look a little closer, and the numbers get starker: In Spain, a quarter of children have a cellphone by age 10, and almost half by 11. At 12, this share rises to 75%. British media regulator Ofcom said 55% of kids in the UK owned a smartphone between ages 8 and 11, with the figure rising to 97% at age 12. Ofcom added another statistic to their report last year: One in five toddlers, ages 3 or 4, owns a smartphone. Parents and schools that have succeeded in flipping the paradigm in their communities told The Associated Press the change became possible the moment they understood that they were not alone. What started as a tool to keep in touch with buddies has morphed into something more worrisome to keep away from kids \u2014 akin, these parents assert, to things like cigarettes and alcohol. In Greystones, Ireland, that moment came after all eight primary school principals in town signed and posted a letter last May that discouraged parents from buying their students smartphones. Then the parents themselves voluntarily signed written pledges, promising to refrain from letting their kids have the devices. \u201cThe discussion went away almost overnight,\u201d says Christina Capatina, 38, a Greystones parent of two preteen daughters who signed the pledge and says there are almost no smartphones in schools this academic year. \u201cIf (kids) even ask now, you tell them: We\u2019re just following the rules. That\u2019s how we live.\u201d For Mo\u0300nica Marque\u0300s of Barcelona, no signed pledge was necessary to get the same result. She polled the parents of her daughters\u2019 grade two years ago and she was surprised to see that \u201c99% of them were as terrified or more so than I was.\u201d She shared the results of her questionnaire, and says that this year, when her daughter started high school, not one student in her grade had a smartphone. And as for that other excuse that kids supposedly need a smartphone so parents can keep tabs on them, Marque\u0300s says an old-school cell phone without Internet access like the one her daughter carries is a perfect substitute. An increasing scrutiny Something like a consensus has built for years among institutions, , parents and others that smartphone use by children is linked to necessary for learning. China moved last year to of smartphones, while France has in place a for kids aged six to 15. The push to control smartphones in Spain comes amid a surge in notorious cases of children viewing online pornography, sharing videos of sexual violence, or even participating in creating \u201cdeep fake\u201d pornographic images of female classmat es using generative artificial intelligence tools. Spain\u2019s government says that 25% of kids 12 and under and 50% of kids 15 and under have already been exposed to online pornography. Prime Minister Pedro Sa\u0301nchez said Spain is facing an \u201cauthentic epidemic\u201d of pornography targeted at minors. The threats include adults taking advantage of minors they meet online, such as the recent arrest of two \u201cinfluencers\u201d in Madrid for having allegedly sexually assaulted underage girls who followed them on TikTok. The dangers have produced school bans on smartphones and online safety laws. But those don\u2019t address what kids do in off hours. \u201cWhat I try to emphasize to other principals is the importance of joining up with the school next door to you,\u201d says Rachel Harper, principal of St. Patrick\u2019s National School, one of the eight in Greystones to encourage parents to refrain from smartphones for their kids. \u201cThere\u2019s a bit more strength that way, in that all the parents in the area are talking about it.\u201d The parents\u2019 concerns are diverse. Some fear the day when their young kids ask to get a phone like their friends. Others have young teens with phones and regret they followed the herd during what they consider a nai\u0308ve phase when screens were just a way to let kids have fun and chat with their friends. Parents speak of having emerged from a state of blissful ignorance about the internet. The home isolation of the COVID-19 pandemic offered a firsthand glimpse of their kids staring at screens and getting clever about hiding what they were seeing there \u2014 and what was finding them. \u201cThe screens were seen as a escape valve that let adults work and kept kids occupied, whatever that meant,\u201d says Macu Cristo\u0301fol, who started a group of concerned parents in Malaga, in southern Spain, after she heard of the ballooning parents group in Barcelona. \u201cThat was when I thought, where are we going? We have become hostages of screens.\u201d Capatina says she saw her 11-year-old daughter change the day she came home from a playground and shared that a girl there had recorded video of the scene on a smartphone. \u201cPanic, panic, panic,\u201d Capatina recalls of her daughter\u2019s reaction. \u201cNothing really major happened,\u201d Capatina says, \u201cbut I saw the pressure and anxiety levels increasing where they hadn\u2019t before. And I thought, that\u2019s not healthy. Children shouldn\u2019t have to worry about things like that.\u201d But if the kids can\u2019t have smartphones, are the parents cutting back their own online time? That\u2019s tough, multiple parents say, because they\u2019re managing families and work online. Capatina, an interior designer, says she shows her kids what she\u2019s been doing online \u2014 work, for example, or schedules \u2014 \u201cto hold myself accountable.\u201d Laura Borne, a Greystones mom of kids ages 5 and 6 who have never known smartphones, says she is aware of the need to model online behavior \u2014 and that she should probably cut back. \u201cI\u2019m trying my best,\u201d she says. But just as with the children she parents, the pressures are there. And they\u2019re not going away. ___ Kellman reported from London.",

    "content": "The Noida Authority said the construction of the new underpass will be completed in 6 months. After the construction begins, one lane of the road under the Mahamaya flyover will be closed to vehicular movement. Updated: June 21, 2024 10:41 AM IST By Traffic jams in Noida will end soon as an underpass connecting Noida Jungle Trail Park to the Mahamaya flyover will open to the public soon. The construction of this underpass will start this week, according to an announcement made by the Noida authority. This underpass marks a significant step to enhance the connectivity to the new park close to the Okhla Bird Sanctuary. The Noida Authority said the construction of the new underpass will be completed in 6 months. After the construction begins, one lane of the road under the Mahamaya flyover will be closed to vehicular movement. The cars coming from Kalindi Kunj in Delhi towards Dalit Prerna Sthal will be restricted to a single lane, to make sure that traffic flow continues only with some delays. This underpass will become a crucial link for commuters, allowing them to commute seamlessly between different sections of the park. The Z-Tech India Private Limited is overseeing the construction of Noida Jungle Trail Park. The new underpass from Noida Jungle Trail is approximately seven meters wide and 24.40 meters long. This underpass is expected to be completed within five to six months at an estimated cost of Rs 2 crore. Noida traffic advisory has been issued for the construction period of the underpass and during this time, traffic police will manage the flow of vehicular movement to minimize disruptions. Cars coming from Kalindi Kunj towards Sector-95 Dalit Park in Noida will be restricted to one lane. Traffic police will be deployed during peak hours to make sure smooth traffic movement.

    "content": "Sport | Cricket The winner of today\u2019s T20 World Cup game between England and South Africa will book their place in the semi-finals. Both teams secured victory to open the second stage of the tournament, the Proteas getting the better of the USA by 18 runs and England beating West Indies by eight wickets. Those results mean that, whatever happens in Saint Lucia, these two are the favourites to qualify from the short Super 8s stage. But the honour of topping the group could be key to the semi-final layout - although there are certainly going to be no easy draws at the penultimate stage. England fans can also breathe a sigh of relief that today\u2019s game does not take place overnight, having endured a 1.30am start last time out. TV channel: In the UK, the T20 World Cup game will be broadcast on Sky Sports Cricket and Main Event channels. Coverage starts at 3pm with the game getting underway at 3.30pm BST.

    "content": "A woman took her boyfriend to New Zealand\u2019s Disputes Tribunal after he failed to take her to the airport, causing her to miss a flight to a concert she had planned to attend. The woman involved had arranged to be picked up by the man, who she was in a relationship with, but he never arrived to collect her. The woman lodged a claim with the tribunal, which said that, in her view, the agreement for a ride to the airport constituted a legally binding agreement. Credit: AP As a result, she missed her flight and had to travel the following day. It was also arranged that he was to stay at her house while she was away and look after her dogs, which he did not do. The details of the case were released on Thursday, with the names of the couple redacted. The woman lodged a claim with the tribunal, which said that, in her view, the agreement for a ride to the airport constituted a legally binding agreement. She said she incurred costs to travel the following day, the cost of a shuttle to the airport and the cost to put her dogs into a kennel. The woman said she ended up paying for the fare and claimed the man would reimburse her. She added the man, whom she had been in a relationship with for over six years, entered into a verbal contract with her that he would take her to the airport and stay in her house while she was away. Tribunal referee Krysia Cowi said in a statement, \u201cpartners, friends and colleagues make social arrangements, but it is unlikely they can be legally enforced unless the parties perform some act that demonstrates an intention that they will be bound by their promises\u201d. \u201cWhen friends fail to keep their promises, the other person may suffer a financial consequence but it may be that they cannot be compensated for that loss,\u201d she said. Ultimately, Cowie decided that although a promise was made, it fell short of being a contract, with the promises exchanged as a normal give and take in a relationship. As a result, Cowie dismissed the women\u2019s claims. The couple have now separated. Stuff.co.nz",

The sun has decided to grace us with its presence and the mercury is gradually rising. According to the Met Office , the good weather is here to stay. Friday should reach balmy highs of 21C, while Saturday should have sunny intervals with highs of 19C (we won\u2019t complain as that will seem tropical after the chilly conditions of late). Sunday will be another warm one, while lots of sunshine is forecast for the next week. Lovely stuff. Given this summer\u2019s slow start, we really need to make the most of it and hit up one of Greater Manchester\u2019s amazing parks, gardens and green spaces. There\u2019s one which is only a stone\u2019s throw away from the city centre yet offers gorgeous riverside views, towering trees and vast green lawns. READ MORE: The gorgeous Peak District hike named among best walk to do this summer The place in question is Peel Park, off the Crescent in Salford . Unless you live in the area you\u2019ve probably never heard of it, making it one of Salford\u2019s best kept secrets. Peel Park sits beside the River Irwell with a wide path running alongside it. It\u2019s the perfect place for a stroll in the sunshine, with Manchester\u2019s skyscrapers visible in the distance. The River Irwell flows beside the park (Image: MEN Staff) Approach the park from Salford Museum and Art Gallery and you\u2019ll find several benches where you can take a seat and admire the view of the landscaped garden below, found at the southern end of the park. Take a slow wander down the sloping path, or descend the steps, and explore the gorgeous flower beds and winding paths. Enjoy a stroll in the sun (Image: MEN Staff) Peel Park has no shortage of lawn where you can roll out a picnic blanket and enjoy a spot of sunbathing or an alfresco meal. With towering trees overhead you can grab a spot in the shade, or choose a more sunnier location. An ice cream van often makes an appearance on sunny days, and there\u2019s a playground for kids too. The vast lawn in the centre is a popular spot for ball games, while runners can be spotted completing laps around the edge. Peel Park is a half hour walk from Deansgate tram stop, or just a few minutes from Salford Central Station. There is some pay and display parking at Salford Museum and Art Gallery, and a bus stop right outside. For more of the latest What's On news, click here.",

    "description": "Two separate rain delays interrupted Australia\u2019s clash with Bangladesh before it was called off.",
    "content": "Australia are on the brink of the T20 World Cup semi-finals after beginning the Super Eight stage with a convincing 28-run win over Bangladesh in rainy Antigua. Pat Cummins (3-29) became only the fourth Australian to record a T20I hat-trick, joining forces with the in-form Adam Zampa (2-24) to restrict Bangladesh to 8-140 with the bat on Friday (AEST). Two separate rain delays interrupted Australia\u2019s run chase, but the retiring David Warner (53 not out from 35 balls) ensured they were well ahead of the DLS par score when play was called off in the 12th over. Know the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today Mitch Marsh\u2019s side finished at 2-100. The win means Australia are likely to progress to the final four at the North American tournament if they beat Afghanistan in their second of three Super Eight games on Sunday. Winning the toss, Australia had Bangladesh\u2019s out-of-form batting order on the back foot when a classic full delivery from Mitch Starc (1-21) cleaned up Tanzid Hasan (0) three balls into the innings. But after that it was veteran tweaker Zampa who did the heavy lifting, twice breaking through as Bangladesh lost 3-26 either side of drinks. Zampa ended the 58-run partnership that had helped Bangladesh recover from the loss of Hasan, his delivery bouncing from the pad of a sweeping Litton Das (16 off 25 balls) and on to the stumps. The innings\u2019 anchor early on and its eventual top-scorer, Najmul Hossain Shanto (41 off 36) did not even contemplate a review when Zampa struck his pad with the last ball of the 13th over. With that dismissal, Zampa moved into outright second for most wickets at the tournament (11), trailing only Afghan quick Fazalhaq Farooqi (15). Towhid Hridoy (40 off 28) breathed life into Bangladesh\u2019s innings, but Cummins (3-29) saw to it that the underdogs never truly clicked into gear. He bowled Mahmudullah for two, then enticed Mahedi Hasan into finding Zampa at third man with the first ball he faced. With his opening delivery of the 20th over, Cummins had his hat-trick when Hridoy clipped him to a stretching Josh Hazlewood in the cordon. Cummins became only the fourth Australian to take a T20I hat-trick after Brett Lee, Ashton Agar and Nathan Ellis, and the seventh player of any nation to achieve the feat at a T20 World Cup. Chasing 141 for victory, Warner rode his luck after Hridoy dropped a tough chance while the veteran opener was on five runs in the second over. He and Travis Head (31) managed more sixes in the power play (four) than Bangladesh did for their whole innings (three) and were 0-64 when rain stopped play in the seventh over. But impressive leg-spinner Rishad Hossain (2-23) gave Bangladesh hope, bowling Head and then continuing Marsh\u2019s lean run of form at the tournament. The Australian captain burned a review after being trapped lbw for one run. Warner flicked Taskin Ahmed for six over deep square leg to bring up his second half-century of the tournament before rain again forced the covers on. Roughly an hour had been lost to play when the game was called off after midnight (local time).",

    "content": "Holidaymakers might want check they have the right travel insurance or they could risk forking out thousands, as one family did when they were hit with a whopping \u00a341k medical bill. The disgruntled Brits described their grandad being held 'hostage' by a Turkish hospital after falling seriously ill while on holiday. Malcolm Stocker was whisked to intensive care at Ahu Hospital in Marmaris, where he spent nearly a month battling pneumonia and slipped into a coma. Thankfully, Malcolm has woken from the coma but the healthcare facility is playing hardball, refusing to let him leave without the hefty \u00a341,000 tab settled, reports . So far, the family has managed to scrape together almost \u00a35,000 through online fundraising efforts, hoping to secure an evac flight back to Blighty for which they'll need about 20 grand. Chiming in with their two pence, one social media user argued: \"This was no matter of checking his insurance, he absolutely travelled knowing full well he had no insurance\". Taking a swipe at Malcolm's decision, another added: \"He was refused insurance for good reason and still insisted on going to Turkey and now his family are attempting to persuade everyone else to pay for him\". Another chimed in with a dose of reality: \"Going abroad without insurance is an absolute no no-rather short sighted -will now have to remortgage his house if a home owner.\" A third raged: \"Everyone should have holiday insurance if travelling abroad. This report is being disingenuous though, saying that you should make sure of certain conditions, which is really irrelevant under the circumstances in this article, simply because of the fact that the tourist did not have any insurance (because it could not happen to him but if it did, he and his friends would ask someone else to pay it for him) as it was refused on medical grounds. \"Totally irresponsible behaviour by the man involved and more fool anyone who pays for his medical bill or return travel.\" Another chimed in: \"The family were very irresponsible in letting him go without insurance, I have no sympathy for them. \"If people are thinking about sending them money they might want to think twice it just encourages reckless behaviour like travelling uninsured.\" The average cost of UK travel insurance is currently \u00a312.60 for single trips and \u00a321.58 for annual policies. For those finding it tough to snag a good deal on travel insurance, chatting with a savvy travel insurance expert might be your best bet.",

    "content": "WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) \u2014 New Zealand\u2019s government will overhaul the tighter gun laws introduced after a deadly mass shooting by a white supremacist five years ago, because they put excessive burdens on gun owners who feel vilified by law enforcement and the public, the lawmaker leading the changes said. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened is a massive change with massive penalties and targets on people who didn\u2019t do anything wrong,\u201d Associate Justice Minister Nicole McKee \u2014 before she entered Parliament in 2020 \u2014 told The Associated Press in an interview this week. Every part of the law will be scrutinized, including the restrictions that bar all but a few hundred New Zealanders from firing banned semiautomatic weapons, she said. McKee\u2019s pledge of a wide-ranging review \u2014 following an earlier announcement that she would ease rules for gun clubs \u2014 was applauded by groups representing the country\u2019s 250,000 license holders and decried by survivors of the 2019 terrorist attack at two Christchurch mosques where an Australian man opened fire on Muslim worshippers, killing 51 people. \u201cIt makes me scared for our futures,\u201d Temel Atac\u0327ocug\u0306u \u2014 who was shot nine times in the attack and fears an erosion of the assault weapon ban \u2014 told the AP. \u201cWhat have the past five years been for? How are they going to prevent this from happening again?\u201d New Zealand drew global admiration when its then-Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said six days after the massacre that her government would outlaw all semiautomatic weapons. The change , and : bolstered licensing requirements, more rules for gun clubs, and the creation of a firearms registry. The changes introduced \u201conerous regulatory compliance,\u201d said McKee, whose political party, Act, campaigned for New Zealand\u2019s 2023 election on a platform for reversing many of them. Now in government as part of a center-right coalition, McKee pledged to update the law before the next election in 2026. Her bloc has enough lawmakers to easily pass any reforms. Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and a spokesperson for Labour \u2014 New Zealand\u2019s largest opposition party, formerly led by Ardern \u2014 have not answered AP requests for comment. McKee said she would consult with the public before deciding specific measures and that her personal views would not direct the overhaul. Critics rejected that. \u201cShe was elected as a gun lobbyist, that was her role,\u201d said Chris Cahill, president of the Police Association, a group representing most New Zealand officers. \u201cShe\u2019s got a loyalty to the gun lobby groups.\u201d The review was \u201cwithout a doubt, a backdoor into giving people access to semiautomatic assault rifles again,\u201d Cahill said. At the time of the ban, McKee denounced it as \u201cknee-jerk.\u201d As a minister she is more guarded, but told the AP that New Zealand had not been entirely rid of such weapons; several hundred people have permits to use them for pest control in rural areas, while others can own but not fire them. \u201cIf we extend the access, what are the possible controls around the use of the extension? And would society be happy with what those controls mean?\u201d McKee said she would ask during the review. \u201cIt\u2019s about how do we find the balance with protecting people but not going over the top with a regulatory regime,\u201d she said. Any concerns raised by opponents should be \u201crealistic,\u201d McKee added. \u201cIt cannot be anecdotal.\u201d New Zealand\u2019s gun laws were safer before the 2019 reforms, the minister said, citing the dozens of pages of information now required for a gun license as an example of changes that could deter gun owners\u2019 compliance. \u201cThat\u2019s absolute rubbish,\u201d said Cahill. Gun laws , he added, and the scrutiny reported by owners in the years since reflected the proper administration of the law after an injection of government funds. McKee will begin by examining the gun registry created after the attacks; some gun owners want it shrunk to only the highest-powered weapons, rather than all guns. She will also explore removing from police oversight the new agency that administers gun licenses and registrations. Gun crime has increased in New Zealand since 2019, according to analysis of official crime figures by New Zealand news outlets. Supporters of the tighter restrictions say , and that a burgeoning problem with violent gang crime is fueling the rise. McKee, and groups representing gun owners, say scrutiny since the attack has fallen on law-abiding license holders at the expense of criminals, who are not captured by the stricter rules. The Council of Licensed Firearms Owners said members had lost or couldn\u2019t obtain licenses because of malicious reports from past partners \u2014 who must be interviewed as part of a person\u2019s application \u2014 or because they had divulged depression to their doctors. Areas of flexibility should be introduced to applications, spokesperson Hugh Devereux-Mack said. \u201cEvery single New Zealander who is not convicted of a serious criminal offense and has no sort of problematic behaviors or serious mental health conditions is eligible to own a firearm,\u201d Devereux-Mack said. The gunman , Brenton Tarrant, moved to New Zealand from Australia, acquired a gun license and amassed a cache of assault weapons, all legally, without drawing the attention of law enforcement until he committed the massacre. The police were censured by Tarrant was incorrectly allowed to nominate a character reference who barely knew him because he did not have relatives in New Zealand who could be interviewed. McKee said the rules that followed have made the system rigid and unwieldy. She would prefer a licensing regime \u201cthat looked at the individual,\u201d she said \u2014 without prompting the same disregard of rules that had allowed Tarrant to receive a license. Devereux-Mack said his group might support an additional practical testing component to gun licensing, and a tiered system with more freedoms for longtime license holders. \u201cNew Zealand won\u2019t be safer if it becomes easier to get a gun,\u201d Atac\u0327ocug\u0306u said. \u201cI have to have an eye test every time I renew my drivers\u2019 license. Gun owners should have similar background and mental health checks every few years to make sure they\u2019re still safe to have guns.\u201d",

    "content": "At 33 years of age, former middleweight champion Robert Whittaker might not be considering retirement but the Aussie boy definitely has plans. Being an avid gamer and streamer, Whittaker ahead of his Saudi Arabia fight, revealed his future plans to Daniel Cormier and a desire to follow the former two-division champion\u2019s footsteps. Talking to the veteran, \u2018The Reaper\u2019 spoke of his hobbies \u2013 media interactions, television gaming, etc. And when asked if he wanted to pursue them if he retired, Whittaker said , In fact, Whittaker revealed that he likes the profile of an MMA analyst and is optimistic that he has what it takes to be an astute commentator to call the shots and deliver exhilarating real-time analysis for the fans. The Aussie also reflected on the job\u2019s complexity- interviewing fighters after commentating on the whole fight to pop right back in the octagon to catch exclusives all while maintaining an approachable tone. But none of that is an immediate concern for Whittaker. Because in just a few days time, he will be fighting Khamzat Chimaev\u2019s replacement, Ikram Aliskerov, a fighter he claims to have never heard of before. While Whittaker is all set to face this new challenge, his former foe backed \u2018The Reaper\u2019 to beat the breaks off of Ikram Aliskerov. Israel Adesanya picks Robert Whittaker over Ikram Aliskerov Having met Whittaker in the octagon twice previously, former middleweight champion, Israel Adesanya knows a thing or two about what it takes to get past the Aussie. Initially slated to face Khamzat Chimaev, \u2018Bobby Knuckles\u2019 got on the grind, wrestling on the mat, ready to tussle a whale, which is why Izzy believes the new Dagestani challenge won\u2019t be a problem for Whittaker at all. Dropping his thoughts on his popular YouTube channel , \u2018The Last Stylebender\u2019 placed his bets on his former foe and predicted that this will be a banger of a fight. Despite admitting that it would be a great opportunity for Aliskerov, the \u2018Stylebender\u2019 believes that if Bobby Knuckles picked up pace, this could be over by the 3rd round and with some gratuitous violence.",

    "content": "WASHINGTON: The State Department on Thursday reiterated that it supports direct talks between Pakistan and India, however, the scope of negotiations should be determined by the two neighbouring countries and not the US. State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller said this in response to a query seeking his comments on recent exchanges that took place between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi over the latter\u2019s securing a third term as the premier. \u201cWe value our important relationships with both India and Pakistan. As we have said, we support direct discussions between India and Pakistan, but the pace, scope and character should be determined by those two countries, not by us,\u201d said Miller. PM Shehbaz on June 10 congratulated Modi on taking oath as the Indian PM. Modi, in response, thanked Shehbaz. Shehbaz\u2019s elder brother and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, also felicitated the Indian PM. \u201cLet us replace hate with hope and seize the opportunity to shape the destiny of the two billion people of South Asia,\u201d he advised Modi. The Indian PM in his response said, \u201cThe people of India have always stood for peace, security and progressive ideas.\u201d \u201cAdvancing the well-being and security of our people shall always remain our priority,\u201d he added. Meanwhile, addressing the department\u2019s press briefing, the State Department spokesperson said the US and Pakistan had a shared interest in combating threats to regional security. \u201cWe partner with Pakistan on security through our high-level counterterrorism dialogue, including several counterterrorism capacity-building programs, and we support a series of US-Pakistan military-to-military engagements,\u201d he said. He was asked about Pakistani Ambassador to US Masood Khan\u2019s statement that Pakistan needed modern American weapons to fight the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), as the terror outfit is \u201cusing American weapons against Pakistani military forces that were left by US forces in Afghanistan\u201d. Miller said, \u201cWe are in regular communication with the Pakistani leaders as a part of our partnership on CT issues, and we will continue to discuss regional security in detail, including through our annual counterterrorism dialogue and other bilateral consultations.\u201d",

A fair few say they're unsatisfied with party politics and most have one thing in common - a deep concern over the state of public services, some of which people say are 'collapsing'. \"The country is a bit of a shambles at the moment in terms of public services,\" Jack, a student at the University of Salford says. \"You could go on for days about the things that need investment.\" READ NEXT: The estate in the Etihad's shadow which residents say 'looks embarrassing' - and the plans for a facelift Many voters tell the M.E.N. they'd rather see investment in vital services than tax cuts. \"Public services are failing all around us,\" one woman passing in Salford Quays says, adding: \"It takes hundreds of pounds just to go to London for the day and the NHS is collapsing.\" Another student from the University of Salford, Elliot, said: \"It is a shambles. The last thing people need is more money in their own pocket, we need that invested into public services.\" Asked about the party leaders, many echoed similar thoughts. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak wasn't exactly flavour of the month. \"Sunak has all the charisma of a brush, he's not relatable at all,\" Elliot added.

    "content": "Australia are knocking on the door of the Twenty20 World Cup semi-finals after beginning the Super Eight stage with a convincing 28-run win over Bangladesh in rainy Antigua. Pat Cummins (3-29) became only the fourth Australian to record a T20I hat-trick, joining forces with the in-form Adam Zampa (2-24) to restrict Bangladesh to 140-8 with the bat. Two separate rain delays interrupted Australia\u2019s run chase, but the retiring David Warner (53 not out from 35 balls) ensured they were well ahead of the DLS par score when play was called off in the 12th over. Mitch Marsh\u2019s side finished at 100-2. T20 World Cup 2024: Australia beat Bangladesh by 28 runs \u2013 as it happened Read more The win means Australia are likely to progress to the final four at the North American tournament if they beat Afghanistan in their second of three Super Eight games on Sunday. Winning the toss, Australia had Bangladesh\u2019s out-of-form batting order on the back foot when a classic full delivery from Mitch Starc (1-21) cleaned up Tanzid Hasan (0) three balls into the innings. But after that it was veteran tweaker Zampa who did the heavy lifting, twice breaking through as Bangladesh lost 3-26 either side of drinks. Zampa ended the 58-run partnership that had helped Bangladesh recover from the loss of Hasan, his delivery bouncing from the pad of a sweeping Litton Das (16 off 25 balls) and on to the stumps. The innings\u2019 anchor early on and its eventual top-scorer, Najmul Hossain Shanto (41 off 36) did not even contemplate a review when Zampa struck his pad with the last ball of the 13th over. With that dismissal, Zampa moved into outright second for most wickets at the tournament (11), trailing only Afghan quick Fazalhaq Farooqi (15). Towhid Hridoy (40 off 28) breathed life into Bangladesh\u2019s innings, but Cummins (3-29) saw to it that the underdogs never truly clicked into gear. He bowled Mahmudullah for two, then enticed Mahedi Hasan into finding Zampa at third man with the first ball he faced. With his opening delivery of the 20th over, Cummins had his hat-trick when Hridoy clipped him to a stretching Josh Hazlewood in the cordon. Cummins became only the fourth Australian to take a T20I hat-trick after Brett Lee, Ashton Agar and Nathan Ellis, and the seventh player of any nation to achieve the feat at a T20 World Cup . skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Spin Free weekly newsletter Subscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week\u2019s action Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He and Travis Head (31) managed more sixes in the power play (four) than Bangladesh did for their whole innings (three) and were 64-0 when rain stopped play in the seventh over. But impressive leg-spinner Rishad Hossain (2-23) gave Bangladesh hope, bowling Head and then continuing Marsh\u2019s lean run of form at the tournament. The Australian captain burned a review after being trapped lbw for one run. Warner flicked Taskin Ahmed for six over deep square leg to bring up his second half-century of the tournament before rain again forced the covers on.

    "description": "Workers in places like warehouses and kitchens where temperatures can rise to uncomfortable levels are getting new protections thanks to Cal OSHA.",
    "content": "RIVERSIDE, Calif. (KABC) -- Summer heat is on the rise and for many workers in Southern California it can be a miserable time of year. Especially for warehouse workers. \"Now that it is getting hotter, I am even more worried about myself and my coworkers. I have seen some people faint from the heat,\" said Carrie Stone, who works at an Amazon warehouse in Moreno. Warehouses operators like Amazon say the company has climate-control measures in place - but they may soon have to do more. On Thursday, the California Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board unanimously passed heat standards titled Heat Illness Prevention in Indoor Place of Employment. \"This is really significant. Up until now workers have not had these rights or protections and there has not been clear guidance to employers about what they need to do to keep workers safe,\" said attorney Tim Shadix with the Warehouse Workers Resource Center. The nonprofit warehouse workers advocacy group was one of several to speak in favor of indoor heat regulations. The new rules require employers to provide heat safety training, cooling areas and water when the indoor temperature reaches 82 degrees. If the temperature exceeds that, then required measures can include cooling devices, adjustments in work schedules, more breaks and slower production pace. \"In my last job as a pastry chef, I suffered from heat illness due to extreme indoor heat,\" said Colleen Koperek with the Restaurant Opportunities Centers United. \"I was dry heaving in between taking rounds of pastries out of the oven and I had to quit, effectively ending my career,\" said Koperek. Koperek is now a restaurant worker advocate who spoke to the board before the vote. Unlike warehouse workers, kitchen employees experience year-round sweltering temperatures. While the indoor heat regulations have the support of employee groups some business advocates worry the regulations would be hard to implement for some businesses. \"We do remain concerned about the feasibility for small employers, particularly those who don't control the physical structure their business is in if you rent space to create the required cool-down zones,\" said Robert Moutrie, policy advocate for the California Chamber of Commerce. Moutrie said the business community did support many of the measures to ensure employee safety. The Heat Illness Prevention in Indoor Place of Employment standards will now go before the Office of Administrative Law (OAL) which has 30 days to review it. However, the CAL OSHA board has asked the agency to expedite the matter in order to have the heat regulations in place sooner.",

    "description": "The IMF recommends Europe implement strategic macroeconomic policies, structural reforms, and increased green investment to address challenges such as reduced fiscal buffers, an ageing population, and low productivity growth.",
    "content": "The IMF recommends Europe implement strategic macroeconomic policies, structural reforms, and increased green investment to address challenges such as reduced fiscal buffers, an ageing population, and low productivity growth. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has released its 2024 Concluding Statements on Common Policies for member countries, highlighting both the progress and the persistent challenges facing the euro area economy. Following the disruptions caused by the pandemic, Russia\u2019s gas supply halt, and the ongoing war in Ukraine, the region is gradually recovering. Inflation rates are moving towards target levels, and banks have demonstrated resilience amid rising interest rates. Nonetheless, significant challenges persist, such as reduced fiscal buffers, an ageing population, and sluggish productivity growth. The IMF's recommendations focus on implementing strategic macroeconomic policies and structural reforms to foster growth and stability. The IMF forecasts modest growth for 2024, with further strengthening in 2025, driven by higher real wages and household savings reductions. \"Increasing real wages and some drawdown of household savings are expected to contribute to a consumption-led recovery,\" the IMF notes. However, long-term growth may be hindered by demographic trends and low productivity. Inflation is expected to reach target levels by the second half of 2025, aided by previous monetary policy tightening and falling commodity prices. Despite this positive outlook, growth risks remain, particularly from potential external shocks such as geopolitical tensions and reduced global demand. The IMF warns that \"growth can also be lower due to adverse external developments, such as intensifying geopolitical tensions.\" According to the IMF's World Economic Outlook released in April 2024, the Euro Area is projected to experience a 1.4% growth in 2024, with inflation anticipated to average around 3%. The IMF advises the European Central Bank to gradually ease its monetary policy based on incoming economic data. The IMF states, \"continued, gradual monetary easing would achieve a balance between keeping inflation expectations anchored and avoiding an overly restrictive policy stance.\" In June, Frankfurt reduced its main interest rates by 0.25 percentage points. However, it did not commit to further rate hikes, stressing a \u201cmeeting-by-meeting\u201d and data-dependent approach. Boosting productivity and achieving climate goals are critical for long-term economic health. The IMF calls for increased investment in digital technologies, administrative reforms to reduce barriers for businesses, and greater labour market flexibility. \"Europe\u2019s economy faces low productivity growth, which will be increasingly problematic as adverse demographic trends intensify,\" the IMF warns. Further integration of financial markets is essential for Europe to meet its goals for energy security, climate change mitigation, and digital transformation. An integrated capital market would facilitate financing for innovative projects and improve the allocation of savings within the European Union. The IMF advocates for \"strengthening ESMA\u2019s ability to coordinate across national authorities and greater harmonization of financial markets oversight.\" Enhancing the EU budget to better target public investment is another priority. The IMF suggests establishing a Climate and Energy Security Facility (CESF) to address long-term challenges effectively. This facility would support EU emissions reduction goals and facilitate investments in energy infrastructure and clean-tech sectors. Climate policy should account for fiscal, efficiency, distributional, and cross-border impacts. Meeting emissions reduction targets requires significant investment, reducing fossil fuel dependence, and boosting energy efficiency to enhance competitiveness. However, short-term costs could arise, the IMF warns. According to the Washington-based institution, Member States should prioritise strengthening the single market and avoid distortive industrial and trade policies that could harm the economy and provoke retaliation. Labour market policies should aim to enhance skills, ease labour reallocation, and counter the effects of a shrinking workforce. Initiatives such as reskilling programmes, unemployment benefit reforms, and support for female labour force participation are essential. The IMF highlights the need for \"fostering mobility across the EU through faster recognition of professional qualifications and more portable pension and social security benefits.\"",

    "description": "The popular pub has undergone a huge transformation and families say they 'can't wait' to visit",
    "content": "Families say they 'can't wait' to try out a newly-refurbished pub with both indoor and outdoor play areas. Previously Applewood Farm pub, on the border of Salford and Wigan in Astley, the place has been transformed into Farmhouse Kitchen and it's not just the signage that's changed. While the venue is still owned by Greene King, customers have been told it's 'an all-new brand and carvery experience' featuring 14-hour slow roasted meats, unlimited veggies and bottomless gravy. Read more: The 'Rolls Royce' of M6 service stations was so good we went twice The new signs are up (Image: Manchester Family / MEN) As well as the carvery, there'll be a new Kitchen cafe, with 'signature cakes, freshly-baked sweet and savoury pastries, and unlimited, self-serve coffee'. One of a chain of similar Farmhouse Inns, including Barley Farm in Eccles , Salford; Pine Tree Farm in Over Hulton, Bolton ; and Ash Tree Farm in Ashton , Tameside ; Applewood had started to look somewhat dated over recent years. But the concept of a pub with space for children to play both inside and out is a popular one with young families, especially one that serves up breakfasts, carvery and its famous Cakeaway desserts too. The inside is brighter and much more modern (Image: Manchester Family / MEN) The company has given us a sneak peek showing the inside of the new-look pub, which features a fresher, brighter dining area, carpets replaced with modern wooden flooring and the old dark furniture replaced with colourful orange and blue chairs and comfy sofa seating. Images have also been shared on social media giving customers a tiny glimpse of what to expect, with the opening date announced as Monday, July 8. Many responded to the post saying how excited they are to visit once it reopens. A glimpse of the new indoor play area being built at the site (Image: Manchester Family / MEN) \"Can\u2019t wait to bring my twin grandsons,\" said one. \"They are obsessed with Applewood, every Monday dinner we used to come, can\u2019t wait for the re-opening.\" Another said: \"I just can't wait for you to open again.\" Greene King says the 'improved menu' will include 'a combination of great value roasted, carved and baked dishes, giving guests more of what they love from the Farmhouse Inns offering'. Nuala Gallagher, brand director said: \u201cWe believe everything tastes better when we\u2019re together, which is why we can\u2019t wait to bring our Farmhouse Kitchen offering to the public. The new carvery area (Image: Manchester Family / MEN) \u201cWe aim to marry up people\u2019s love for a carvery with all the delights of a classic cafe\u0301, creating a space where there is something for everyone to enjoy, with a hugely varied menu that offers great value. \u201cThis is such an exciting new space to step into, we look forward to welcoming local family and friends, and to see them pulling up a chair at a Farmhouse Kitchen table later this summer.\u201d We've been given a sneak peek at the inside of the new Farmhouse Kitchen (Image: Manchester Family / MEN) When booking online, customers will be able to select a table in 'main dining', 'family dining', or 'family dining near to play area'. Standard carvery will cost \u00a38.99 Monday to Friday, \u00a311.99 on Saturday and \u00a313.99 on Sunday and bank holidays. Small carveries will cost \u00a36.49, \u00a38.99 and \u00a311.49 respectively. A Yorkshire pudding and two pigs in blankets is an extra \u00a31.50.

    "content": "A Gruffalo maze is opening 90 minutes from Manchester this summer. The much-loved children's book character has been revealed as the theme for this year's Giant Maize Maze at York Maze and opens on July 13. The attraction has shared a number of photos to promote the event, but is keeping an aerial shot of the maze under wraps until the opening date. Read more: Chester Zoo launches half price tickets for special summer event The giant maize maze opens at York Maze next month (Image: York Maze) If previous years are anything to go by, with mazes themed around everything from Harry Potter and Star Wars to Lego and the Lion King, families will have a real treat in store as the venue marks 25 years of The Gruffalo story, written by Julia Donaldson and illustrated by Axel Scheffler. Creating the maze is no easy feat. Every year farmer Tom Pearcy cuts out over 5km of pathways in his 15-acre field (the equivalent of eight football pitches) and plants more than a million maize seeds. It's only when the crop is fully grown by mid July that the image is fully formed and can be viewed from the air, a bit like crop circles. Star Wars was the theme for 2017's maze (Image: York Maze) \u201cI used to love reading The Gruffalo to my children,\" said Tom. \"It is something that appeals to grown-ups too. My design celebrating 25 Years of The Gruffalo has been cut out using GPS technology to plot the pathways. It is nerve wracking because I can\u2019t tell if I\u2019ve made a mistake and put a path in the wrong place until July when the maize plants are fully grown and the final image is revealed.\u201d Alex Sanson, senior brand manager for The Gruffalo at Magic Light Pictures, said: \u201cWe are so excited to see The Gruffalo as a maize maze as part of his 25th birthday celebrations. \"The Gruffalo\u2019s Child is also featured in the design as she is marking 20 years this year. We hope that families in the local area will love exploring the Gruffalo Maize Maze and enjoy celebrating this special birthday!\u201d. Families have to navigate the maze of pathways in the crop to find the six viewing platforms and the special photo points featuring the animals in The Gruffalo story. There's lots more at the attraction, including a Volcorno for kids to climb up and slide down (Image: York Maze) As well as the giant maze, the place is home to a number of smaller corn mazes, including the Jurassic Maze, featuring some life-sized dinosaurs. There's a Maze of Illusions, with all sorts of mind bending puzzles and illusions; a Mineshaft Maze, a 3D labyrinth of crawl tunnels, bridges and overhead walkways; a Sunflower Fortune Maze, which involves colouring the ends of your fingers at different stations; and the Musical Maze, with the sound of drums, xylophones, tubular bells and more guiding you through it. There's loads more to enjoy at the venue too, including more than 20 different rides, attractions and shows. There's a climbing frame, an inflatable Cobstacle Course, a giant Popcorn Pillow, Corn Snake Tower slides, a Volcorno for kids to climb up and slide down and loads more. The attraction also has a Jurassic Maze among its smaller corn mazes (Image: York Maze) The maze opens for the summer on Saturday, July 13 and remains open until September 2. Tickets can be booked online . You can get early bird tickets from \u00a319.50 each for a set date. The most popular tickets are the 'advance flexible' tickets where you book for a certain date, but can swap to a different date if your plans change. These cost \u00a322.50. Under threes go free.",

    "content": "MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle sparred with one of her guests Thursday night in what became a tense exchange about former President Donald Trump's meeting with business leaders in the nation's capital. Amanda Carpenter, a writer and editor at the organization Protect Democracy, appeared as a panelist on the show to discuss Trump's political and financial support post-conviction. When the conversation steered toward's Trump's return to Capitol Hill last week, Carpenter called the Business Roundtable's response \"disturbing.\" \"And what that was, was an exercise in getting the Republican Party around him and the business leaders to say, like,'listen \u2014 they all put out this idea that we are unified by an economic agenda. Now, I kind of think that is garbage because Donald Trump is not campaigning on an economic agenda. He is campaigning against the rule of law, he's campaigning on his grievances, but there was a massive show of unity behind tax cuts, right? And that was enough to get people on board.\" Ruhle disagreed with Carpenter's assessment \u2014 and butted in, cutting off her guest. \"Well, I ... hold on a minute! I'm going to push back,\" she said. Ruhle noted the Business Roundtable made \"no statement\" after Trump's visit. When Carpenter tried to continue her point, Ruhle forcefully repeated: \"Hold on a minute!\" \"There could be a general sense that they support tax cuts, but Andrew Ross Sorkin had reporting from people inside the room from people leaning towards Trump, and they said he was meandering, he was difficult to follow,\" said Ruhle. \"They left feeling really disappointed. And it wasn't just Donald Trump's opportunity to go back to the business community, the business roundtable every four years invites both candidates. This wasn't Donald Trump's grand return and they endorsed him \u2014 he got absolutely no endorsement for the business roundtable.\" Ruhle finished noting Biden couldn't attend \u2014 his chief of staff attended, instead \u2014 because he was attending the now-famous G7 summit in Italy. ALSO READ: \u2018They could have killed me\u2019: Spycraft, ballots and a Trumped-up plot gone haywire Carpenter shot back: \"Yeah, I understand all that. I think Donald Trump is so out of the norm, I do not know why these leaders in the business community felt the need to meet him face-to-face. What is the deal with that?\" She continued, appearing slightly flustered, saying: \"In the aftermath of January 6th a lot of leaders in the business community said, 'You know what, that is a bright red line. We're not going to have donations to it.' And slowly they all started coming back around. And the reason they came back around is because he is the Republican presidential nominee, and they feel they need to at least go there and save the face, give him a chance and preserve their standing, and their foothold, which I understand from an economic perspective.\" When Ruhle tried to interject again, her guest gave a forceful reply. \"This is why the money will be there for him, Stephanie. \"The money will be there for him again, and if he wins again, they will be back on board.\" Ruhle pushed back on Carpenter's statement again, saying the business leaders are not saying they'll give him money, they're showing up because Trump has about a 50 percent chance to regain the presidency. \"They have to not necessarily endorse him,\" Ruhle tries to say, as the two continue talking over one another. \"But they have to interface with him.\" \"No they don't!\" replied Carpenter. \"That's their choice \u2014 I understand why they are doing it to preserve their business standing and they have to make this financial bet, so to speak.\" Carpenter returned to her previous point that Trump is \"far out of the norm for the rule of law\" and said there needs to be a deeper understanding and study of how \"authoritarianism represented by Donald Trump is bad for the economy.\" \"Businesses, except for the ones that are in really good with the leader, don't do great in an authoritarian regime,\" she said. On that, Ruhle agreed. \"Amen to that. If you do not have a functioning democracy, you're economy will be nowhere bu the toilet,\" said Ruhle. Watch the clip below or at this link. Mary Trump thinks Uncle Donald is \"scared\" and blames Fox News for being all too eager to whip up a frenzy. The 78-year-old's niece and psychologist detailed the presumptive nominee's paranoia at play in her latest newsletter \"The Good In Us.\" Titled \" Donald Is Desperate: 'Cheap fakes' and what they reveal, \" Mary points to the decision by Trump's \"minions\" pulling the strings at the Republican National Committee \u2014 but also \"paid propagandists\" at Fox News for parading an uptick of \"cheap fakes\". Together she writes, they have \"started deceptively editing and clipping videos to make it look like President Joe Biden is wandering off in a daze or freezing up.\" She notes that these clips are strategically edited and have succeeded in \"going viral (while the debunking of them has not) and right-wing extremists are posting them on social media to paint Biden as a cognitively impaired old man who is losing touch with reality.\" ALSO READ: Neuroscientist explains how Trump and Biden's cognitive impairments are different And this is where she accuses Fox News of forgetting hundreds of millions of regrets from pushing unproven narratives from its airwaves when they settled with Dominion Voting Systems . \"Apparently, Fox hasn\u2019t learned a damn thing from having to fork over $787 million for lying to the American people about the 2020 election while defaming Dominion Voting Systems, because they\u2019re doubling down on their dishonesty,\" she explains. Despite putting an end to the lawsuit with Dominion, Fox News is also facing a $2.7 billion defamation lawsuit brought by the voting system company Smartmatic . For Mary, the so-called \"cheap fake\"s aren\u2019t simply dishonest but \"they\u2019re dirty... Even for politics. \"Even for the paid propagandists at Fox. Even for the Republican Party.\" It's the continuous loop of Biden gaffes and stumbles that she believes are straight out of Donald's \"alley.\" Mary writes that it's a Trump play to institute an \"effective low-blow strategy\" that is proving the level of desperation by Trump and his \"enablers\". But the \"cheap fakes\" intended to undo Biden are pure projection. \"Everything we know to be true about Donald \u2014 his tendency to wander off aimlessly, literally and rhetorically, his propensity for waving to people who aren\u2019t there \u2014 we\u2019re suddenly seeing Biden doing in manipulated videos.\" The move of attacking Biden, who is a few years older at 81, is to deflect Trump's own \"impairments\" and \"lapses.\" \"And they are desperate,\" she argues. \"But not because he\u2019s losing\u2014or not only because he\u2019s losing\u2014but also because he\u2019s losing it. They know it and, on some level, he knows it, too.\" There's one solution that she is hoping Trump might consider: quitting. \"For the good of the Republican Party, and the country,\" according to Mary, \"Donald needs to step aside and let some other authoritarian, America-hating extremist take over the nomination.\" CONTINUE READING Show less The top prosecutor in the \"Show-Me\" State picked a legal fight Thursday against the \"Empire State\" for its prosecutions of former President Donald Trump . \"I will be filing suit against the State of New York for their direct attack on our democratic process through unconstitutional lawfare against President Trump,\" Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey declared in a post on X, formerly Twitter . \"We have to fight back against a rogue prosecutor who is trying to take a presidential candidate off the campaign trail.\" And as to why an attorney general is picking a fight with another state, he claims it's because the moves in court are hamstringing the presumptive nominee's capability to stump to become the 47th president. Bailey added: \"It sabotages Missourians\u2019 right to a free and fair election.\" Bailey expects his case to go straight to the Supreme Court because it involves a state versus state action. His office already titled the matter: \"Missouri vs. New York.\" ALSO READ: Neuroscientist explains how Trump and Biden's cognitive impairments are different Trump has lost civil and a criminal case against him in numerous cases including defamation, civil fraud, and his criminal case involving a 34-count indictment against Trump for falsifying business records . The Missouri AG specifically poked Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg for acting politically when he successfully secured a guilty verdict. \"We have to fight back against a rogue prosecutor who is trying to take a presidential candidate off the campaign trail,\" Bailey added in another tweet clearly aimed at Bragg, but not naming him. Bailey charged \"radical progressives in New York [for] trying to rig the 2024 election,\" according to Fox News . \"We have to stand up and fight back.\" When Bragg ran for Manhattan district attorney in 2021 it was on a platform of \u201cjustice and public safety.\" And when he was asked about the criminal investigation into Trump and how Cyrus Vance Jr., the outgoing DA didn't bring a formal charge, Bragg expressed his intentions. \u201cI don\u2019t know where this investigation will go. I don\u2019t want to prejudge it. But, these types of investigations \u2014 white-collar investigations \u2014 I\u2019ve been involved with for years, both doing them myself and also supervising them,\u201d he said at the time. The lawsuit comes weeks ahead of a primary where Bailey is fighting to keep his AG post in a fierce GOP contest. Come Aug. 6, voters will decide to stay with Bailey or put their support behind Will Scharf, Trump's attorney who has been a mainstay in the news counterpunching for the gag-ordered convicted presidential contender. CONTINUE READING Show less Donald Trump's trial and eventual conviction on dozens of felony counts in his hush money case didn't hamstring the former president's fundraising efforts, instead proving a boon for him and the party \u2014 and shrinking President Joe Biden's fundraising lead as the two head into a key first debate next week. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, the Republican National Committee and an allied super PAC raised over $170 million in May , The Washington Post reported Thursday night. That includes a massive haul following Trump\u2019s felony conviction May 30 \u2014 the Trump campaign said it hauled in $53 million online in the 24 hours following his guilty verdict. The main super PAC supporting Trump MAGA Inc. was reportedly flushed with $69 million last month and had $94 million in cash. That number notably included a $50 million donation from reclusive heir Timothy Mellon , which marked one of the largest ever disclosed single donations. MAGA Inc. also received a $10 million bump from Richard and Elizabeth Uihlein, as well as $5 million from Kelcy Warren. ALSO READ: \u2018They could have killed me\u2019: Spycraft, ballots and a Trumped-up plot gone haywire Meanwhile, Trump and the national committee raised about $106 million last month \u2014 much higher than in previous months \u2014 and ended with a combined $171 million in cash. The GOP windfall took a chunk out of the Biden campaign\u2019s once-massive fundraising lead. Now, the GOP reportedly plans to spend big on media buys through the summer. The Biden campaign hasn't yet filed its report but said it raised $85 million last month. The president's team said it had $212 million in cash heading into June. CONTINUE READING Show less",

    "description": "The electric vehicle giant saw its revenues jump 24% as government subsidies boost China's car industry.",
    "content": "The Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD has seen its quarterly revenues soar, beating Tesla's for the first time.It posted more than 200bn yuan ($28.2bn, £21.8bn) in revenues between July and September. This is a 24% jump from the same period last year, and more than Elon Musk's company whose quarterly revenue was $25.2bn.However, Tesla still sold more electric vehicle (EVs) than BYD in the third quarter.It comes as EV sales in China have been getting a boost from government subsidies to encourage consumers to trade their petrol-powered cars for EVs or hybrids.BYD also notched a monthly sales record in the last month of the quarter, in a sign that momentum continues to build for China's bestselling car maker.But there is a growing backlash abroad against the Chinese government's support for domestic car makers like BYD.Earlier this week, European Union tariffs of up to 45.3% on imports of Chinese made EVs came into force across the bloc.Chinese EV makers were already facing a 100% tax from the United States and Canada.The tariffs are in response to alleged unfair state subsidisation of China's car industry.As of last week, official data showed 1.57 million applications had been submitted for a national subsidy of $2,800 per each older vehicle traded in for a greener one.That's on top of other government incentives already in place.China has been counting on high-tech products to help revive its flagging economy, and the EU is the largest overseas market for the country's electric car industry.Its domestic car industry has grown rapidly over the past two decades and its brands, such as BYD, have begun moving into international markets, prompting fears from the likes of the EU that its own companies will be unable to compete with the cheaper prices.",

    "description": "Treasury secretary speaks out to reassure the markets after a rise in the cost of government borrowing.",
    "content": "Rachel Reeves' Budget is \"very, very different\" to the Liz Truss mini-Budget of two years ago, according to a senior government minister.Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones's comments were designed to reassure markets following a rise in the cost of government borrowing and a fall in the pound in the wake of Wednesday's Budget.The amount the government has to pay lenders has risen after the chancellor announced a big increase in government borrowing to finance spending projects, sparking fears it may need to raise even more money.Jones told the BBC it had put in place new rules to make sure spending on public services was paid for by tax receipts \"not borrowing every single month\".He said investors always reacted to Budgets because they \"present a whole load of new information\".\"We've all got a bit of anxiety from what happened when Liz Truss was in government.\"We've got strong fiscal rules in place so that day-to-day spending on public services is paid for by tax receipts, not borrowing every single month, which is what the last government did, and we've got a strong investment rule that means that while we're investing in the country, debt is falling as a share of the size of the economy.The interest rate – the so-called yield – the government has to pay lenders when it borrows money from them over a 10-year period, for example, climbed just above 4.52% on Thursday, its highest level for a year, before falling back to 4.45% on Friday.The 10-year bonds are regarded as being the benchmark measure of how much the government has to pay to borrow.The yield on the shorter term two-year bonds - which are usually more sensitive to market announcements - saw similar movements.UK government bonds or gilts are regarded as being one of the safest forms of investment because it is thought very unlikely the government would not be able to repay the money.If the yield rises, it is a signal that investors see it as being riskier to lend the government money.This matters because not only does it mean the government will have to pay more to borrow, but bond yields are also used as a guide for setting the rates on everyday loans and mortgages.The knock-on effects of the Reeves Budget were already being felt in the market, said David Hollingworth, from mortgage broker L&C.Initially some smaller lenders withdrew mortgages, but they have been followed by bigger, mainstream lenders, with Skipton and Coventry building societies both announcing fixed rate increases to take effect early next week.“It’s confusing times for mortgage borrowers when expectation is for a base rate cut [by the Bank of England] next week but fixed rates look set to rise,\" said Mr Hollingsworth.However, if market rates remain at current levels, he said it looked \"inevitable\" that more lenders would have to rethink their rates.\"Borrowers currently considering a fixed-rate option should move quickly to secure a deal as we’re seeing some rates withdraw with very little notice.”",

    "content": "The US economy grew solidly in the three months to September, expanding at an annual rate of 2.8%.Despite there being a slight slowdown from the prior quarter's 3% rate, the figures released by the Commerce Department showed the US is on track for one of the strongest economic performances of any major economy this year.Consumer spending was the biggest driver, picking up from earlier in the year.The report arrives days before polls close in America's hotly contested presidential election, in which surveys have consistently indicated the economy is Americans' top concern.It is not clear the latest figures will do much to assuage people's worries.Economic sentiment, which darkened abruptly during the pandemic, has remained downbeat, as a roughly 21% jump in prices over the past four years overshadows other economic news, no matter how positive.This month, a solid 62% of Americans viewed the economy overall as \"bad\", according to a poll by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.In a country where the mantra \"it's the economy, stupid\" - coined by strategist James Carville in 1992 - is often deployed to explain elections, one might expect the worries to be bad news for Kamala Harris and the Democrats, as the party in the White House.Donald Trump has tried to seize on the opportunity, making his economic record as president, which is remembered as a rosier time, a key part of his pitch to voters.But as opinions have grown increasingly coloured by a person's political views over the last few decades, analysts said it is not clear how big a role the economy will actually play in shaping the election outcome this year.",

    "description": "The government's official forecaster raises its prediction for UK growth in 2024 and 2025 but reduces it for later years",
    "content": "The Budget will only “temporarily boost” the economy, according to official forecasts, throwing into question the government’s promises to reboot growth.The pace of growth will peak next year at 2% before falling back to around 1.5% later in the parliament, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said.The government has pinned its reputation on delivering growth, arguing that a new approach to investment would underpin a better economic performance and “more pounds in people's pockets”.But the OBR said in the short term the Budget would push up inflation and interest rates, with a knock-on effect on growth.Overall that would leave the size of the economy \"largely unchanged in five years\" compared to its previous growth forecast, the OBR said.In her speech, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: \"Every Budget I deliver will be focused on our mission to grow the economy.\"She also promised \"an end to short-termism\".The package of policies includes tax increases to the tune of £41bn a year by the end of the parliament to finance more spending on public services.“The OBR pointed to a short-term sugar rush, as a result of the debt-financed spending splurge, but that turns into a modestly negative impact by the end of the parliament,” Paul Johnson, head of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, an independent economics think tank, said in a note.The OBR said in the longer term investment, planning reform and greater economic stability should help to boost growth, \"in a sustainable way\" Mr Johnson said, but not until 2032.",

    "content": "Buttler, 34, has been with Rajasthan since 2018 but they have opted not to keep him before the Mega Auction.Teams are allowed to retain up to six players from 2024, including five international capped players.No England players have been retained, meaning the likes of Phil Salt, Sam Curran - who commanded a then-IPL record £1.85m in 2023 - Liam Livingstone, Jonny Bairstow and Jofra Archer could be available in the auction.Australia seamer Mitchell Starc, who became the IPL's most expensive player in the 2024 season when Kolkata Knight Riders paid 24.75 crore Indian rupees (£2.3m) for his services, has also not been retained.The highest retention price is for South Africa wicketkeeper Heinrich Klaasen, who has been retained by Sunrisers Hyderabad for 23 crore Indian rupees (£2.1m).Klaasen is just one of 10 overseas players retained, with others including Australia captain Pat Cummins and batter Travis Head (both Sunrisers Hyderabad), Afghanistan leg-spinner Rashid Khan (Gujarat Titans) and West Indies' Nicholas Pooran (Lucknow Super Giants) and Andre Russell (Kolkata Knight Riders).Indian superstars Jasprit Bumrah and Rohit Sharma (both Mumbai Indians), Virat Kohli (Royal Challengers Bengaluru) and Ravindra Jadeja (Chennai Super Kings) are among those to be kept.Some of India's key players will enter the draft though, with KL Rahul (Lucknow Super Giants), Rishabh Pant (Delhi Capitals), Ravichandran Ashwin (Rajasthan Royals) and Mohammed Siraj (Royal Challengers Bengaluru) among those released.Among the overseas players not to be retained are Australia's Glenn Maxwell and Cameron Green (Royal Challengers Bengaluru) and South Africa's Anrich Nortje (Delhi Capitals), David Miller (Gujarat Titans) and Quinton de Kock (Lucknow Super Giants).MS Dhoni, 43, will play for Chennai Super Kings again after being signed as an uncapped player. A rule change means anyone who has not played international cricket for five years becomes uncapped.Sides who have not utilised their six retentions are given Right-to-Match cards to use at the Mega Auction, which means some players could still be retained.However, Buttler and Starc will not return to Royals or Knight Riders because they have kept six players.Players will have to decide whether to enter the auction around their international commitments, because the IPL has introduced a two-year ban on players who pull out of the tournament without certain requirements being met.The dates for the auction are yet to be confirmed, but it is expected to take place over two days in late November.The schedule for the tournament itself is also unknown, but usually takes place in April and May.",

    "content": "The incident happened a week after the 20-year-old had made his debut on the PGA Tour.Guan had surgery in New South Wales and spent two weeks in intensive care after being transferred to Sydney for a second operation.Speaking publicly for the first time since the incident, he revealed doctors said he is unlikely to ever regain vision in the eye.Nevertheless, Guan - who had been playing professionally for a year - is targeting a return to the elite level of the game.\"As a kid I always had a lot of perseverance,\" Guan told BBC Sport.\"Obviously there are going to be many obstacles in the way. But the quicker you can get over them, the stronger you will be.\"That’s the philosophy mentally for me and I guess that has been to my advantage so far.\"I want to play back at the top level professionally. That's the main goal for me.\"'I dropped to the floor and don't remember much after that'Guan is a two-time Australian junior amateur champion, following in the footsteps of major winners Adam Scott, Jason Day and Cameron Smith by winning the title.He then achieved a long-held dream by making his PGA Tour debut, at the Procore Championship in California, playing in a field featuring American Ryder Cup pair Wyndham Clark and Max Homa, plus English former Masters champion Danny Willett.A week later, he was back in New South Wales playing the pro-am at Catalina Club - where the unthinkable happened.Having hit his second shot from the third fairway, Guan turned towards his buggy to put the iron back in his bag.\"That was when I was struck,\" Guan said.\"I remember I dropped to the floor and I could feel a throbbing pain at the top of the left hand side of my head. I wasn't too sure what it was.\"It was a massive area around the eye and the cheekbone and later I found out it was fractures around the eye.\"I don't really recall too much about what happened after that. I just remember being taken to hospital.\"In intensive care, Guan was alone with his thoughts every night.The frustration was \"unbearable\" as he tried to process what had happened and the prospect of potentially losing his career.",

    "description": "Trump has boasted that he can quickly end the Ukraine war.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON - Donald Trump has made plain his fondness for Russian leader Vladimir Putin, who has in his own way returned the favour. But if Trump comes back to the White House, their divergent interests could still make the relationship complicated. Ahead of Nov 5’s razor-tight election, Vice-President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, has hammered in on Trump’s long history with Mr Putin, telling a rally on Oct 29 that the Russian leader and other strongmen were “rooting” for Trump, knowing he is “easy to manipulate with flattery and favour”. Trump has repeatedly praised Mr Putin, whose hyper-masculine style and professed attachment to traditional values has increasingly found favour among some US Christian conservatives. At a rally in March, Trump praised Mr Putin as “smart” – yet also faulted his February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, saying that sending troops to the border had been “a hell of a way to negotiate” but that going in was a “big mistake” that did not turn out well. The Republican tycoon nonetheless has mused that Russia will eventually win and scoffed at the billions of dollars in US assistance sent to Ukraine under President Joe Biden and Ms Harris. Trump’s running mate, Mr J.D. Vance, has gone so far as to say he does not care what happens in Ukraine, believing that the US should focus on confronting China instead. Trump has boasted that he can quickly end the Ukraine war, with his aides suggesting forcing Ukraine into territorial concessions by conditioning US assistance. He has dismissed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as a great “salesman”. When Mr Zelensky requested a meeting with Trump in September, Trump told the wartime leader how he enjoys a “very good relationship” with Mr Putin. A new book by the investigative reporter Bob Woodward asserts that Trump and Mr Putin may have spoken as many as seven times during Mr Biden’s presidency, and that Trump while in office secretly sent the Russian leader then-scarce Covid tests. ‘Vladimir, let’s talk’ Mr Putin in September said with a wry smile that he supported Ms Harris, an endorsement believed by virtually no one. Former president and Putin ally Dmitry Medvedev more recently hailed Trump for blaming the war on Mr Zelensky, although he cast doubt on whether the Republican would change US’ position. “It’s clear that Trump is Russia’s preference, no matter what they say,” the Russian political expert, Mr Konstantin Kalachov said. “Trump clearly wants to negotiate and there is no love between him and Mr Zelensky,” he said. Trump was impeached for the first time in 2019 over delaying assistance to Ukraine as he pressed Mr Zelensky to dig up dirt on the Biden family. In one of the most widely criticised moments of his tumultuous 2017-2021 presidency, Trump at a joint news conference appeared to take the Russian leader’s word over US intelligence assessments that Russia tried to tilt the 2016 election in his favour. Mr Leon Aron, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, expects that Trump, if elected, would quickly seek another summit with Mr Putin. Based on Trump’s past behaviour and statements, “I think the initial step will be some sort of very dramatic personal diplomacy – ‘Vladimir, let’s talk. We could resolve this.’” But Mr Aron said it was less certain whether Mr Putin, whomever he prefers as US president, would budge on policy. “Mr Putin made global opposition to the US a key to his domestic legitimacy and popularity,” Mr Aron said. “He is now proclaiming himself and his country heirs to the Soviet Union – a great superpower.” “So that policy strategically will continue. Mr Putin cannot change it without changing his regime,” he said. Mr Putin would gladly accept a quick Ukraine agreement if it validates seizure of land and allows Russian troops to remain. But Trump would then face pressure from the US public, Congress and possibly his own advisers who would see him as negotiating a bad deal, Mr Aron said. “I think his macho image would argue against essentially accepting a defeat of American interests in Ukraine.” AFP",

    "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Hacking a local election system in the United States wouldn’t be easy, and secretly altering votes on a scale massive enough to change the outcome of the presidential race would be impossible, election officials have said, thanks to decentralized systems, paper records for nearly all ballots, exhaustive reviews, legal due process and decades of work by American election officials, volunteers and citizens.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Hacking a local election system in the United States wouldn’t be easy, and secretly altering votes on a scale massive enough to change the outcome of the presidential race would be impossible, election officials have said, thanks to decentralized systems, paper records for nearly all ballots, exhaustive reviews, legal due process and decades of work by American election officials, volunteers and citizens. But foreign actors and domestic extremist groups looking to meddle in next week’s election can target a much weaker link: voters’ perceptions and emotions. Those intent on undermining confidence in U.S. democracy don’t have to change any votes if they can convince enough Americans not to trust the outcome. It’s a possible scenario particularly concerning to intelligence analysts and officials tasked with protecting America’s election: An adversary tries to hack a state or local election system and then releases a document — perhaps a fake one or even material that is publicly available — and suggests it’s evidence of vote rigging. Or, a video is crafted showing someone supposedly hacking into a ballot scanner, voting machine or a state voter registration system. But it hasn’t happened, and it would not be true. It’s called a perception hack, which may or may not include an actual breach of voting systems but is made to appear that has happened. In some cases, minor information might be stolen — enough for a video to appear legitimate — but it does not change votes. A related threat involves fake footage supposedly depicting election workers destroying ballots. In either case, the goal is the same: to generate confusion, distrust and fear. Governments at all levels have worked to strengthen election infrastructure in recent years. The human brain, however, remains hard to defend. “I think that’s almost certain to happen,” former CIA political analyst Adam Darrah said when discussing the risk of perception hacks. Darrah, now vice president of intelligence at the cybersecurity company ZeroFox, said misleading people into thinking election systems are vulnerable is a lot easier than actually hacking into them. “It’s a way to induce panic. We are very technically resilient. Our emotional resilience, our hypersensitivity, that’s still a challenge.” Narrow margins of victory or delays in vote counting could heighten the risk that a perception hack could fool a large number of voters, further polarizing the electorate, raising the risk of political violence and potentially complicating the transfer of power in January. Intelligence officials warned last week that Russia and Iran may consider encouraging violent protests in the U.S. following the election. The nation’s intelligence community and private analysts agree that while the Kremlin is backing former President Donald Trump, Moscow’s ultimate goal is to divide Americans and undermine U.S. support for Ukraine and the NATO alliance. America’s adversaries focus on disinformation in part, officials say, because they understand the country’s election infrastructure is too secure to hack successfully. Despite the findings of intelligence officials, both Russia and Iran have rejected claims that they are seeking to influence the U.S. election. “We have never interfered, we are not interfering, and we do not intend to interfere,” a spokesman for the Russian Embassy in Washington wrote in an email to The Associated Press. Even without a foreign power’s involvement, isolated stories of long lines at the polls, ballot mix-ups or other irregularities could be held up as proof that elections can’t be trusted. It happened in 2020, when Trump amplified claims about election problems, helping lead to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters trying to disrupt certification of the election. The former Republican president has spent months laying the groundwork to challenge the results of this year’s election if he loses. And he has worked to convince his supporters that the only way he can lose is if Democrats cheat, urging them to deliver a victory “too big to rig.” “They cheat,” Trump said at a Michigan rally last month. “That’s the only way we’re going to lose, because they cheat. They cheat like hell.” Just as in 2020, the days immediately after the election are likely to be the most critical, as results are announced and Americans come to the end of a contentious race. It’s then that authoritarian nations or domestic anti-democratic groups will look to whip up distrust in an effort to spur people into action, said Paul Barrett, a New York University law professor who studies online discourse and polarization. “They’re happy to see Americans at the throats of other Americans,” Barrett said. “We saw that in 2021, and I have tremendous anxiety that we will see a repeat.” In response, national security and election officials across the country have moved to expose disinformation and quickly knock down rumors. Top intelligence officials have held multiple briefings outlining foreign threats, while cybersecurity and election officials have explained why election systems are secure. Last week, a video purporting to show someone destroying mail ballots in Pennsylvania began spreading on social media. Bipartisan election officials in Bucks County quickly debunked the video, and intelligence officials linked it to a Russian campaign behind other videos seeking to smear Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. “That video was debunked pretty quickly on multiple news sites, and I know that Bucks County immediately got out in front of it and basically explained why it was a fake and why voters should have confidence,” said Kim Wyman, former secretary of state in Washington state who also has worked at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. “But the problem is — now it exists out there,” she said. “And we know that it will continue to be circulated between now and probably Inauguration Day.” Americans can help prevent a successful perception hack by not spreading election hoaxes any further. Disinformation experts urge voters to consult a variety of sources of information, be skeptical of anonymous social media claims and turn to their own state and local officials for the facts. Uncertainty and emotions will be running high in the days after voting ends — exactly the conditions foreign adversaries and domestic extremists need to undermine trust. “Our foreign adversaries are looking to attack our democratic process to further their own objectives, and we need the help of all Americans in ensuring they are not successful,” said CISA senior adviser Cait Conley. “Americans should be confident that their votes will be counted as cast. They should also know that our foreign adversaries will try to make them believe otherwise.” “We encourage everyone to remain vigilant, verify the information they consume, and rely on trusted sources like their state and local election officials,” she added.",

    "description": "It illustrates a sophisticated tactic to seed false election narratives in trusted online spaces.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON - Dozens of Facebook groups bill themselves as Ms Kamala Harris fan pages but mount racist attacks, criticise her record on immigration and promote her rival Donald Trump, in what disinformation researchers call a “bait-and-switch” tactic aimed at deceiving voters in a tight US election race. The Washington-based American Sunlight Project analysed over 300 groups on the Meta-owned platform that masquerade as pro-Harris pages while misleading the Democratic contender’s supporters with abusive, hateful posts or capitalise on her popularity to promote merchandise. The proliferation of such Facebook groups, which typically bring together communities with shared interests, does not appear to be an organised effort and illustrates a sophisticated tactic to seed false election narratives in trusted online spaces. “These are usually places where there is a high level of trust between members, making them more likely to believe what is being shared there, whether that is election disinformation, miracle cures or memes,” Ms Nina Jankowicz, ASP’s co-founder and chief executive, told AFP. The “bait-and-switch” tactic appears to target actors across the political spectrum, including Trump. But Ms Jankowicz, the former Department of Homeland Security disinformation chief, said her research outfit noticed an “explosion” of such groups focused on Ms Harris since she entered the presidential race over the summer . One group purports to be a space for “Kamala Harris fans,” with its “about” section hailing her as a “trailblazer, a symbol of diversity, and a champion for justice and equality.” But inside the group, posts seek to undermine Ms Harris, including one with a photo of a brown woman smearing her face with black paint alongside the caption: “Kamala getting ready to talk to Black people.” The post echoed Trump’s false claim that Ms Harris “turned Black” and that she was exploiting her race to woo African-American voters. Ms Harris is the first Black, South Asian and woman vice-president in US history. Another group that calls itself “Democratic voices for President Kamala Harris 2024” posted messages in support of “Make America Great Again” – the political movement and slogan popularised by Trump. One video posted in the group showed Mr Charlie Kirk – a conservative influencer whose political organisation is focused on getting Trump reelected – promoting the Republican’s anti-immigrant rhetoric. A similar group savaged Ms Harris as a “border czar” who has failed to curb undocumented migration into the United States – an attack line constantly repeated by Trump and his supporters. One other group calling itself “Kamala Harris 2024“ posted a sexist meme mocking the preference of some voters for a “female president” in the face of what it depicted as pressing issues confronting the country. Many of the “Harris” groups analysed by ASP were run by lone actors, including some non-US moderators in Africa or Eastern Europe. Some groups posted about topics unrelated to the vice-president, including religious cult-like content, and were hotbeds for spam and merchandise sales. Many were not started from scratch, having changed their names several times to capitalise on trending issues to gain traction, ASP said. There was no immediate comment from Meta, which has previously extolled Facebook groups in commercials for their power to bring people together. The so-called bait-and-switch strategy appears to violate Meta’s policies regarding inauthentic behavior or “complex deception,” which among other things forbids the use of its platforms to deceive users about the purpose of content. ASP said the groups it analysed were a representative sample, and it was unable to get a fulsome picture of the scale of the abuse after Meta in August shut down CrowdTangle – a digital tool researchers hailed as vital in monitoring falsehoods. Meta has replaced it with a Content Library, a technology that has similar functionality but is still under development. ASP shared samples of a handful of similar “bait-and-switch” groups dedicated to Trump. “This phenomenon isn’t unique to Harris – groups are used and abused this way across the political spectrum and across topics,” Ms Jankowicz said. “As we get closer to Election Day and during what is likely to be a tumultuous transition period to follow, it’s important that people slow down and try to be more deliberate when consuming content online,” she added.

REUTERS/Megan Varner/File Photo WASHINGTON - Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger's office said on Thursday \"targeted disinformation\" circulating online about the Nov. 5 U.S. election was probably a result of \"foreign interference attempting to sow discord and chaos.\" The office, working with state and federal officials to track the source of the disinformation, urged billionaire Elon Musk, owner of X, and other social media companies, to remove it, saying it probably came from \"Russian troll farms.\" Georgia is one of seven battleground states in Tuesday's election, which polls show to be a tight race between Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican former President Donald Trump. U.S. agencies have said Russia intends to fan divisive narratives ahead of the election, an accusation Russia has denied. \"Earlier today, our office became aware of a video purporting to show a Haitian immigrant with multiple Georgia IDs claiming to have voted multiple times,\" Raffensperger's office said in a statement. \"This is false, and is an example of targeted disinformation we've seen this election. It is likely foreign interference attempting to sow discord and chaos on the eve of the election.\" It is illegal to vote more than once in a U.S. election. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) was investigating, Raffensperger's office added. \"In the meantime, we ask Elon Musk and the leadership of other social media platforms to take this down,\" it said. \"Likely it is a production of Russian troll farms.\" Some posts from Thursday on X showed a video with claims that \"illegal Haitian immigrants\" had voted multiple times in Georgia. One such post drew more than half a million views. It is illegal for noncitizens to vote in U.S. federal elections and state and private reviews have turned up very few instances of them doing so. Still, Trump and his allies have argued that large numbers of noncitizens could vote. REUTERS Join ST's Telegram channel and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

    "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) — White House press officials altered the official transcript of a call in which President Joe Biden appeared to take a swipe at supporters of Donald Trump, drawing objections from the federal workers who document such remarks for posterity, according to two U.S. government officials and an internal email obtained Thursday by The Associated Press.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — White House press officials altered the official transcript of a call in which appeared to take a swipe at supporters of , drawing objections from the federal workers who document such remarks for posterity, according to two U.S. government officials and an internal email obtained Thursday by The Associated Press. earlier this week with his remarks to Latino activists responding to made by the comedian who referred to the U.S. island territory of Puerto Rico as a “floating island of garbage.” Biden, according to a transcript prepared by the official White House stenographers, told the Latino group on a Tuesday evening video call, “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters — his — his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American.” The transcript released by the White House press office, however, rendered the quote with an apostrophe, reading “supporter's\" rather than “supporters,” which aides said pointed to Biden criticizing Hinchcliffe, not the millions of Americans who are supporting Trump for president. The change was made after the press office “conferred with the president,” according to an internal email from the head of the stenographers' office that was obtained by The AP. The authenticity of the email was confirmed by two government officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters. The supervisor, in the email, called the press office's handling of the matter “a breach of protocol and spoilation of transcript integrity between the Stenography and Press Offices.” “If there is a difference in interpretation, the Press Office may choose to withhold the transcript but cannot edit it independently,” the supervisor wrote, adding, “Our Stenography Office transcript — released to our distro, which includes the National Archives — is now different than the version edited and released to the public by Press Office staff.\" The edit of the transcript came as the White House scrambled to respond to a wave of queries from reporters about Biden’s comments. The president's remarks clashed with Vice President near-simultaneous in which she called for treating Americans of differing ideologies with respect. The Trump campaign quickly moved to fundraise off the quote, and the next day, Trump himself held a photo op to try to capitalize on Biden's criticism. Harris on Wednesday distanced herself from Biden’s comments — making the clearest break from the president since she took over for him at the top of the Democratic ticket just over three months ago. “Let me be clear,” she told reporters, “I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for.” According to the email, the press office had asked the stenographers to quickly produce a transcript of the call amid the firestorm. Biden himself took to social media to say that he he was not calling all Trump supporters garbage and that he was referring specifically to the “hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump’s supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally.” The stenographers office is charged with preparing accurate transcripts of public and private remarks of the president for preservation by the National Archives and distribution to the public. The two-person stenography team on duty that evening — a “typer” and “proofer” — said any edit to the transcript would have to be approved by their supervisor, the head of stenographers’ office. The supervisor was not immediately available to review the audio, but the press office went ahead and published the altered transcript on the White House website and distributed it to press and on social media in an effort to tamp down the story. White House senior deputy press secretary Andrew Bates that evening also posted on X the edited version of the quote and wrote that Biden was referring ”to the hateful rhetoric at the Madison Square Garden rally as ‘garbage.’” The supervisor, a career employee of the White House, raised the concerns about the press office action — but did not weigh in on the accuracy of the edit — in an email to White House communications director Ben LaBolt, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre and other press and communications officials. “Regardless of urgency, it is essential to our transcripts’ authenticity and legitimacy that we adhere to consistent protocol for requesting edits, approval, and release,” the supervisor wrote. The supervisor declined to comment to The AP and referred questions about the matter to the White House press office. Asked to comment, Bates did not address the alteration of the transcript and said: “The President confirmed in his tweet on Tuesday evening that he was addressing the hateful rhetoric from the comedian at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally. That was reflected in the transcript.” House Republicans, meanwhile, were debating launching an investigation into the matter. House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., and House Oversight and Accountability Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., on Wednesday accused White House staff of “releasing a false transcript” of Biden's remarks. In a letter to White House counsel Ed Siskel on Wednesday, they and internal communications related to Biden's remarks and the release of the transcript. “White House staff cannot rewrite the words of the President of the United States to be more politically on message,\" the lawmakers wrote to Siskel. Stefanik and Comer said the action could be in violation of the Presidential Records Act of 1978. — Madhani reported from Las Vegas. Aamer Madhani And Zeke Miller, The Associated Press",

    "description": "Undecided voters in the US who turn to Google may see dramatically different views of the world - even when they're asking essentially the same question",
    "content": "We're at the mercy of Google.\" Undecided voters in the US who turn to Google may see dramatically different views of the world – even when they're asking the exact same question.Type in \"Is Kamala Harris a good Democratic candidate\", and Google paints a rosy picture. Search results are constantly changing, but last week, the first link was a Pew Research Center poll showing that \"Harris energises Democrats\". Next is an Associated Press article titled \"Majority of Democrats think Kamala Harris would make a good president\", and the following links were similar. But if you've been hearing negative things about Harris, you might ask if she's a \"bad\" Democratic candidate instead. Fundamentally, that's an identical question, but Google's results are far more pessimistic.\"It's been easy to forget how bad Kamala Harris is,\" said an article from Reason Magazine in the top spot. Then the US News & World Report offered positive spin about how Harris isn't \"the worst thing that could happen to America\", but the following results are all critical. A piece from Al Jazeera explained \"Why I am not voting for Kamala Harris\", followed by an endless Reddit thread on why she's no good.You can see the same dichotomy with questions about Donald Trump, conspiracy theories, contentious political debates and even medical information. Some experts say Google is just parroting your own beliefs right back to you. It may be worsening your own biases and deepening societal divides along the way.\"We're at the mercy of Google when it comes to what information we're able to find,\" says Varol Kayhan, an associate professor of information systems at the University of South Florida in the US.",

    "content": "The messaging app Snapchat is the most widely-used platform for online grooming, according to police figures supplied to the children's charity the NSPCC.More than 7,000 Sexual Communication with a Child offences were recorded across the UK in the year to March 2024 - the highest number since the offence was created.Snapchat made up nearly half of the 1,824 cases where the specific platform used for the grooming was recorded by the police.The NSPCC said it showed society was \"still waiting for tech companies to make their platforms safe for children.\"Snapchat told the BBC it had \"zero tolerance\" of the sexual exploitation of young people, and had extra safety measures in place for teens and their parents.Becky Riggs, the National Police Chief’s Council lead for child protection, described the data as \"shocking.\"\"It is imperative that the responsibility of safeguarding children online is placed with the companies who create spaces for them, and the regulator strengthens rules that social media platforms must follow,\" she added.The gender of the victims of grooming offences was not always recorded by police, but of the cases where it was known, four in five victims were girls.Nicki - whose real name the BBC is not using - was eight when she was messaged on a gaming app by a groomer who encouraged her to go on to Snapchat for a conversation.\"I don't need to explain details, but anything that you can imagine happening happened in those conversation - videos, pictures. Requests of certain material from Nicki, etcetera,\" her mother, who the BBC is calling Sarah, explained.She then created a fake Snapchat profile pretending to be her daughter and the man messaged - at which point she contacted the police.She now checks her daughter's devices and messages on a weekly basis, despite her daughter objecting.\"It's my responsibility as mum to ensure she is safe,\" she told the BBC.She said parents \"cannot rely\" on apps and games to do that job for them.",

    "description": "Amazon has called its latest AI assstant Rufus. But what is the story behind this unusual moniker and how does it compare to the way other AIs have been named?",
    "content": "In Ancient Rome it was a sobriquet for those blessed with red hair. The ruddy complexion of Wiliam II of England – the third son of William the Conqueror – also earned him the same nickname. Today in the UK, the forename \"Rufus\" has acquired a somewhat blue-blooded air. But it is perhaps more common to hear it being hollered by dog-walkers out for a stroll with their furry friends due to its delightful onomatopoeic similarity to barking.So, it may raise some eyebrows to learn that online retail giant Amazon has chosen to give its latest AI assistant the same name. In November 2024, it will be 10 years since Amazon announced its first voice-activated smart assistant Alexa. The name was apparently chosen in homage to the ancient Library of Alexandria in Egypt.But the origins of the company's latest assistant's moniker are arguably far cuddlier – Rufus is named after Amazon's first \"office dog\".Rufus now joins a growing list of AI assistants offered by big tech companies with obscure names. Google's Gemini originally had the project title \"Titan\", but was swapped for its current name by the DeepMind team who were developing it. Gemini is Latin for twins, pointing at the collaboration between the DeepMind and Google Research teams on the project, but also to the dual personality attributed to the Gemini zodiac sign.The name for the recently launched Apple Intelligence – which is bringing AI features to the Cupertino-based tech giant's devices – doesn't take a genius to figure out. But its Siri digital assistant was named by Dag Kittlaus, the co-founder of the company that developed the voice-activated software, who named it after a Norwegian colleague before it was acquired by Apple. In Norwegian means \"beautiful woman who leads you to victory\", but the name was also easy to pronounce, according to Kittlaus.",

    "content": "As the chief anaesthesiologist at CHUV University Hospital, Patrick Schoettker is all too aware of the complications which can follow a lengthy operation under general anaesthetic.Rapid blood loss from the surgical site can send the patient into shock, triggering sudden and dangerous dips in blood flow through the body. But patients can also develop severe lung problems after many hours of deep sedation, a complication which accounts for a quarter of all deaths within the first six days of surgery.Such tragedies sometimes occur due to underlying frailties in the patient's physiology which had gone undetected. But what if hospitals had a quick, low-cost way of screening for them ahead of major procedures? Schoettker and his colleagues are conducting a trial which involves fitting patients with a smartwatch known as the Masimo W1 several weeks ahead of their pre-operation consultation. The data it has collected is then used to form an assessment of their state of health.The W1 provides continuous readings of heart rate, respiration rate, blood oxygen, pulse rate and even hydration levels, all to medical-grade accuracy. Schoettker describes the layers of information as being akin to a \"digital twin\", and believes it could help save lives.\"We plan to use this pre-operatively acquired data to predict possible pre or postoperative complications and act on them in a preventative way,\" says Schoettker.This is just one example of how the booming smartwatch market – some analysts have predicted that more than 400 million devices will be sold worldwide by 2027 – is opening up a bold new era of preventative health. Masimo, Apple, Samsung, Withings, FitBit and Polar have all developed watches capable of recording an extraordinary amount of data, allowing measurements such as sleep quality, blood pressure, heart rhythm variation and blood oxygen saturation levels – a marker of how well the heart and lungs are functioning – to be tracked in real-time.",
